            "selftext": "\nI am 5'5, black, average body type (I do work out 5 days a week). I have naturally black shoulder length hair (currently honey blonde). I have big brown eyes, my lips tend to be my most admired feature to others, I have medium size breast, small booty (to me at least) and I value hygiene over everything! I love to cook, I am primarily a home maker. I enjoy reading mangas and watching anime. On the outside I am a well-put together woman with her life together and can handle almost anything life throws at me. I am married, my husband has shown interest in being my Dom, but his progress is slow. So, we decided until he is comfortable we are ok with me having a Dom of my own (He will in no way be apart of our dynamic, he is not a sub/switch or anything else you may ask. Just know he won't be hoping for anything more than a friendship with you. For those curious how I would juggle two guys. I have done it for the past 6 years so I know its possible.\n\n  \nNow that I've explained my grown up side, lets explore the sub in me:\n\n  \nI discovered I had a sub side after meeting my first Dom on a Camgirl website (Yes I was said Camgirl) at first it was a bit hard for me to relinquish control to someone I barely knew, but after experiencing my first play session, I discovered there was a side of me even I didn't know existed! We dated, we had fun, and then we separated (it was hard, but we ended on a positive note) since then I have been searching for a Dom who understands the value in earning his right to be with me. Most of my \"Doms\" after were in no way shape or form ready for the emotional and mental strain being with me comes with. Because of the consist break of trust, honesty and transparency. I took a 1year break from d/s relationships, not only was my mental and emotional state broken but my body was used by men who didn't understand the concept of what it meant to be a \"True Dom\". So I said all of that to say, if you got this far in this post it must mean you are 100% certain you can handle the hardship, the emotional insecurities, the mental illness and all the bad that comes with being a sub who wasn't appreciated then excellent \n\n   \nNow for the good parts:\n\n*I am a sub who values a Dom with time: If you feel sending a meaningful \"Good morning or Good night text\" is too hard for you, then don't even bother messaging me.\n*Doms who think approaching me not knowing me from Adam, calling me \"slut, whore, etc\" is going to make me respond just don't waste your time.  \n*I easily go into middle space with my Dom if he knows how to PSYCHOLOGICALLY comfort or turn me on I guess. If you don't get this then google it. I get more turned on by your voice and words versus a naked picture of you. Degrading and praising\" are my top fav kinks, but it has to come from someone who knows how to do it correctly and he must hold the title of my Dom.\n*I am a total freak, I love sending pictures, sext, and send videos! So if you love that then I'm the girl for you. I typically write erotica so if you\u2019re a reader and would like to read some please let me know.\n* I am also a MIDDLE so if you have no experience or understand what a regressive dynamic is like please don\u2019t message me\u2026\n\nWhat I would like in my Dom:\n\n  \n-I believe in TRUST, HONESTY, TRANSPARENCY and HEALTHY COMMUNICATION, if that's not you we are not meant to be. \n- Someone who understands not all subs are interested just for play, some of us want to know our Doms are thinking about us at work, or he sends random flowers to you for your 1 month anniversary, or that he randomly calls just because he misses you.  \n- I  DO NOT want ANYTHING CASUAL (you might ask you're married though so why not) my marriage really has nothing to do with it. As I have said, I have done it and it is possible to have a COMMITED, CONSISTENT Dom who is DEDICATED to ONLY ME!\n-If you are married and your wife is unaware of your extra-curricular activities DO NOT message me! See above as to why\ud83d\ude0a\n- I am not a stickler on age, but just for appearances lets say 25-45 (healthy/active 25-45 please!) I believe its less about how old someone is, and more about their mental maturity. I've had Doms younger who were more mentally mature and educated on being a Dom than someone older who just though choking in the bedroom meant he was a Dom.  \n-I want someone who values hygiene as much as I do. I either wax or shave, I expect the same (not hating on anyone who doesn't mind a little pube hair, but it's not for me) A nicely kept beard (if you have one), nicely groomed hair, and appearance. I also workout, so I would like someone who does the same (a body type that is more muscle than fat. Telling me your weight does ntn for me).  \n- I do not discriminate against race, but I welcome anyone who believes after reading this far they could be a good fit. I would say I'm fairly attractive so I'd love someone who is visually appealing as well (I WILL ASK FOR A PICTURE, so come prepared and please send something that will give me a proper representation of what you look like from head to toe---I will do the same as well if we are a good fit.\n- I am a sucker for a sexy, deep voice. I'd be the girl opting to masturbate to my Daddy saying \"Who's a good girl for Daddy\" over watching porn lol.  \n- Someone who understands if all a girl wants from you is time and attention, in return you get her time, attention, obedience, and if your lucky (sex) that's a steal.  \n- Someone who is on my EST TIME ZONE, I do not mind other time zones if it's just a 1-3 hr difference but if I'm going to be sleeping while you're awake and vice versa and you're not making any effort to communicate with me then it won't work for either of us.  \n- Someone who values other conversations. I want to build an emotional and mental connection with you first before we have sex. For me once we have those two, when we finally have sex it will mean that much more.\n- Lastly, I would prefer someone circumcised (I had a negative experience with someone and I haven\u2019t been able to move past it)\n\nI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t match the preference for a lot of you, so please respect mine. If you know you don\u2019t fit the physical attributes needed, please don\u2019t put me in the position to turn you down :(\u2026 it\u2019s a very uncomfortable experience for women\u2026\n\n  \nAll in all, if you've made it this far, then why not just reach out and see if we connect...",

My bfs bad about hiding stuff from me, and this girl was blowing up his phone, calling, texting i miss you and I love yous, clearly in the open. ive never talked to this girl before. When i confronted him about it, he told me it wasnt like that. \nshe comes to my house with a bouquet of flowers for me, and i want to be honest, it felt like i either died or like it was a \"sorry i tried to fuck your boyfriend\" gift. I feel like im reading something wrong, or maybe nothing at all. But, it was probably the most awkward thing i thing i experienced in my life.",

            "selftext": " His ears ringing, Fred regained his bearings as he almost tripped over the imperial champion, who was splayed out on the ground, her three remaining limbs reduced to bloody tatters and oozing flesh-wounds.\n\nOh and the gas-canister next to her head seemed to have drained itself of its payload before the champion had actually died \u2013 though judging from how much difficulty she seemed to have breathing, then it seemed to be just a question of time before the champion would die.\n\n\u201cAre you going to be as stubborn as the house Xilas champion?\u201d Fred asked in a loud tone, not sure if he could be heard properly through his air-tight helmet.\n\nLady K\u2019Vir, the imperial champion, exalted by the silver throne to be the bearer of the tiberon rifle\u2026 she was confused. How could this have happened? Exactly what had actually happened? It had all happened so fast\u2026 and breathing hurt, she could feel her lungs crackle... and the pain.. oh the pain, it was making everything hazy\u2026 and why couldn\u2019t she feel her arms?\n\nFred was not impressed with the champion staring blindly into the sky. Was she in shock? Probably \u2013 but come on\u2026 this moron was supposed to have read up on how Fred fought, hell she had been at his fight with the house Xilas champ, right? Damnit.\n\nTurning to the orbiting camera drones, Fred shouted: \u201cShe\u2019ll die if she doesn\u2019t get help \u2013 Can someone call off the hunt?\u201d\n\nThe cameras kept orbiting \u2013 silence. Lady Vris had told Fred that she wouldn\u2019t have a connection to Fred during the hunt. Fred had also been told that officially the hunt didn\u2019t end until the quarry was down\u2026 and there was no record of a hunt ever failing.\n\nGiving Lady K\u2019Vir a poke just elicited some half-choked groans, though judging from the pool of blood spreading in the scorched grass around her then she didn\u2019t have much time left. Lovely.\n\n\u201cCome on \u2013 call this off! I\u2019m not going to murder her or anyone who comes and rescues her\u201d Fred shouted, the desperation in his voice perfectly audible to the camera drones.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nIt was a deadly silence as Fred just sat down in the scorched grass, watching the imperial champion die. Oh, he was going to need so many hot showers.\n\nIt felt like forever, but three silver disks appeared in the sky after a while. A total of seven shining ones appeared on them, approaching the imperial champion all the while looking at Fred as if he was going to jump up and eat them. Sure, he\u2019d turned off his smoke machinery, but he was still heavily armed.\n\nClad in purple and silver, the shining ones appeared to administer some kind of emergency medicine to Lady K\u2019Vir using baseball-sized silver orbs they kept poking her with, but from the way they quickly seemed to collapse around her and start crying, then they had probably gotten there too late.\n\nOk, the champion was dead. Great. Fred got up and pulled off his helmet \u2013 it hadn\u2019t quite been made to allow or that, but he knew where to yank to rip some of the seams: \u201cI\u2019ll carry her\u201d\n\nThe shining ones huddled around the late champion looked horrified and scurried away as Fred approached. Picking up the champion, Fred got on to one of the disks: \u201cCome on \u2013 didn\u2019t you come here to bring her out of here?\u201d\n\nThe seven grouped up on the two remaining disks, following Fred as the three disks flew off a hatch out of the dome. The swarm of camera drones followed them, still orbiting Fred and the late champion.\n\nThe flight to the exit took a lot longer than Fred had though, though not long enough justify the rescuers late appearance. The champion felt very\u2026 light\u2026 very drained, so many bits missing. That had not been a good death. The corpse wasn\u2019t even bleeding that much anymore.\n\nOutside, Fred\u2019s disk put him down what appeared to be a large hall full of hundreds of shining ones. Some of them looked angry, plenty of them looked horrified. Lady Vris was up in front as well \u2013 flanked by shining ones who were holding her arms, she looked oddly pleased, despite appearing as if a prisoner.\n\n\u201cLady Vris \u2013 I think I won\u201d Fred said, sounding very much as if he had just admitted defeat.\n\nIt was obvious that whoever it was flanking her and holding her taught, then they seemed quite on edge as Fred stepped up in front of Lady Vris. She simply nodded: \u201cYou don\u2019t \u2018win\u2019 the hunt \u2013 you survive it\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t\u201d Fred replied, kneeling down while holding the remains of the champion up.\n\nShrieks of horror, gasps and other utterances of despair and shock rang out in a cacophony as Fred put the body down on the floor. It seemed that the crowd in the hall hadn\u2019t been completely in the loop about the results of the hunt.\n\nThe corpse was quickly snatched away, Fred gladly giving up the mangled body. Lady Vris had an expression that betrayed the fact that she was thinking \u2013 a lot \u2013 and she seemed stuck between bad thoughts and happy thoughts\u2026 which made sense to Fred. He had honestly hoped that he would have been able to \u2018just\u2019 disable the champion enough to force her to abandon the hunt, and she knew this.\n\n\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d Fred asked as he got up again, feeling tired in his armor and in his mind.\n\nLady Vris looked to her left, then to her right, all the while still facing Fred: \u201cWe\u2026 normally there would be a grand party with the champion after this, celebrating the champion\u2019s hunt and the trainer\u2019s contribution\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will order your fighter to disarm himself\u201d the shining one female on Lady Vris\u2019s left said, sounding angry but in a controlled manner.\n\nFred raised an eyebrow and looked down at himself. He had his oversized grenade launcher slung around his back- that could easily be detached, but a lot of the weapons and other fun things he had brought to the fight were integrated into his armor\u2026 of course, it seemed that Lady Vris\u2019s captors didn\u2019t know that.\n\nTaking his grenade launcher and popping out the ammo drum, then tossing the rifle on the floor, Fred looked at the captor once more all the while hooking the half-empty grenade drum to his belt: \u201cThere we go \u2013 now, who are you and what exactly are going on here?\u201d\n\nThe other captor shot Fred a dirty look, as if the human had violated some unspoken rule simply by speaking out of turn: \u201cBe silent and follow\u201d\n\nThe captors turned and escorted Lady Vris towards the exit of the hall. Fred found the situation rather amusing, mainly because Lady Vris had been smiling so much \u2013 she clearly wasn\u2019t worried... or at least wasn\u2019t letting it show.\n\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s going on Lady Vris? Who are your new friends\u201d Fred called out as he followed the three. That nobody was trying to \u2018arrest\u2019 him was a bit odd.\n\nAt first Lady Vris laughed, then she turned her head all the way back to look at Fred \u2013 a feat that looked so small amount of unnerving to him: \u201cOh its nothing\u2026 they\u2019re agents of imperial court, won\u2019t tell me their name \u2013 bad form and all \u2013 said I\u2019m arrested for murdering the imperial champion\u201d\n\nHer smile and cavalier delivery of that information made Fred choke back a giggle: \u201cRight, how terrible. I mean, it must be incredibly embarrassing for the imperial house to have picked a champion that weak and inept \u2013 oh the shame\u2026 say, Lady Vris, do you think you\u2019ve been arrested just to cover all of this up?\u201d\n\nHer left-side captor yanked Lady Vris\u2019s head back: \u201cBe silent \u2013 both of your!\u201d\n\n\u201cOr what? You don\u2019t have a champion to enforce your punishments \u2013 and you\u2019re just \u2018agents\u2019, glorified messengers. You can\u2019t do anything to me\u201d Lady Vris quipped, laughing between almost every word.\n\nThis was another curious detail of shining one culture that Fred had been briefed on prior to the arrival at the silver throne: Apparently house champions also doubled as executioners and general-purpose enforcers. Being the only house member allowed to actually exert violence, champions were the ones who had to enforce court rulings, doing things like executing escaped slaves/servants, stripping house members of honor, and other such fun things. He had seen this in play at a couple of post-fight celebrations where rowdy and drunk party-goers occasionally had to be brought to heel \u2013 and that would always be by the local champion.\n\nTo this end, Fred had hoped that his \u2018hunt\u2019 would at least have resulted in the imperial champion figuring that it would be a really bad idea to pursue Fred outside of the preserve \u2013 or otherwise try to enforce any kind of punishment Lady Vris might get slapped with on account of Fred not playing nice in the hunt. Oh sure, the champion dying had also been an outcome they had discussed \u2013 but they had agreed that it wasn\u2019t optimal, since it would effectively be\u2026 well\u2026 murder, which is why Lady Vris was being hauled off to court.\n\nStill, Lady Vris\u2019s quip had obviously stung the two enforcers, to which her right-side captor seemed to tighten her grip even more so, causing Lady Vris to flinch: \u201cSilence! His imperial highness has activated the champion trainees and granted them temporary access to the imperial arsenal \u2013 there will be plenty of executioners for available for your trial\u201d\n\n\u201cThe emperor has activated the questors? For me? Oh, he shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\nOk, that was\u2026 less ideal, maybe\\`?\n\nFred considered just pulling out a knife \u2013 of which he had plenty hidden in his armor \u2013 and just stabbing the two captors in their backs, but\u2026 they were in the middle of the imperial space station, so getting away might be an issue. Oh well, another trial by combat shouldn\u2019t be too difficult, especially if it would be against some backup force.\n\nA quick disk-ride later the four arrived at a grand courtroom. Of course, but by \u2018court\u2019 it should be understood that this was a royal court, an imperial court even. Courtiers by their thousands floated about the walls on very luxurious-looking disks decked out with comfy furniture, small tables, with at least two or three servants milling about behind each of them, most of the servants being from alien species that Fred had never seen before.\n\nAt the centre of the court was a very obvious throne, upon which a pair of shining ones sat \u2013 the emperor and empress, though the very bright lights around the throne made it difficult to actually see them. This was a grand display of power and endless wealth, probably meant to make the emperor and empress look divine to some extent \u2013 make them look too powerful to gaze upon.\n\nThe throne itself was all silver and other similar shiny or reflective materials, the walls of the room decked with purple banners bearing the imperial silver-star crest, and in front of the throne \u2013 armed with tiberon rifles \u2013 stood well over a dozen\u2026 child soldiers.\n\nWell, shining one children \u2013 their skin still had the pre-teen mottled features that quite obviously betrayed their age, and they all looked to be struggling in vain to hold up the heavy rifles. The idea of killing champion trainees, or \u2018questors\u2019, was one thing, but killing child soldiers? They all looked ready to shit themselves when Lady Vris and Fred were led up before the throne.\n\nHaving finally arrived, the two enforcers released Lady Vris and made themselves scarce, leaving Fred to wonder exactly how much of a kangaroo court this was going to be.\n\n\u201cLady Vris of House Xilas, you stand accused of murder and desecration of the sacred tradition of the champion\u2019s hunt, how do you plead?\u201d The empress stated, her booming voice ringing out from unseen speakers all around the massive courtroom, the lights around her making it very difficult to make out anything beyond a silhouette.\n\nGiving Fred a quick look, Fred saw a silver glint in the eyes of Lady Vris \u2013 this was new \u2013 but she quickly turned to face and address her charges: \u201cI, Lady Vris of House Xilas, proclaim my innocence of both charge\u201d\n\nThe court remained largely silent, quiet murmurs ringing out.\n\n\u201cA bold claim considering the circumstances \u2013 explain yourself\u201d the empress said in an amused tone, making an almost casual gesture toward Lady Vris to bid her to speak, all the while the blindingly illuminated silhouette of the emperor was brought a drink of some kind by a servant who looked very old and miserable in the heat of the lights, though the emperor did not move to take it, the servant taking the drink away.\n\nFred caught a fleeting look from the imperial servant\u2019s eyes as the creature stepped out of the light \u2013 a look of what he perceived as sadness \u2013 as Lady Vris spoke up: \u201cThe late champion was famed for spending time examining the records of her quarry for the hunts. Her failure to adequately anticipate that my fighter would do as he has always done; develop a way to defeat anything that would come to kill him in an arena, is not a crime on my behalf. Additionally, then there are plenty of precedents of other former champions having been injured in the hunts, so it is well known and accepted that the hunt is dangerous, and that the quarry more often than not will try to fight back. To this end I cannot see how my submission of this fighter desecrated the hunt, or how such could be construed as murder. The late champion Lady K\u2019Vir knew the danger of her hunt before the it started and risked her life willingly\u201d\n\nThe court erupted in loud murmurs, even shouts and disparaging remarks could be heard \u2013 apparently then speaking your case against the imperial throne was\u2026 not good form? Or maybe it was just thousands of sycophant courtiers trying to suck up.\n\n\u201cSilence in the court! Lady Vris \u2013 your arguments raise valid points. I recall seeing the former champion Lord O\u2019Ji being injured and close to death in his last hunt, so that is true, but the ease by which your fighter took down Lady K\u2019Vir\u2026 I find it difficult to not believe that you were not aware of such stratagems. That is what makes you complicit in murder, as Lady K\u2019Vir could not have known that she was walking into a fight with someone who had somehow found a means to counter the tiberon\u201d the empress replied, her tone calm and understand \u2013 but Fred couldn\u2019t help but noticing that she wasn\u2019t looking at Lady Vris\u2026 she was looking at the courtiers nearest the throne.\n\nLooking at those courtiers, Fred found a lot of harsh and judging looks being sent towards the empress \u2013 which made sense: the mob wanted blood, but the empress seemed to recognize that Lady Vris hadn\u2019t really done anything all that wrong.\n\nLady Vris again threw a quick glance at Fred, then looked back at the empress: \u201cYour highness \u2013 at my instruction my fighter informed Lady K\u2019Vir that he had means of countering the tiberon before the hunt. She knew what she was entering into, a-\u201c\n\nThe outcry from the court, as thousands of shouts and shrill howls of anger rang out, made for an impressive cacophony, drowning out what Lady Vris had been trying to say. The empress quickly called to order: \u201cSilence! Lady Vris will be heard as is court protocol! Now, do go on\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, your grace. As I was about to say, then in addition to having verbally warned the imperial champion, then he also did not kill the champion directly: Once she had been downed he repeatedly refused to kill her directly, and even requested that medical assistance be sent \u2013 assistance, mind you, that came far too late. I counted almost eight minutes from my fighter ceasing his fight to aid arriving \u2013 that should have been more than enough time to recover the champion still alive. The question of guilt for the champion\u2019s death should lie at the hands of the rescuers failing their charge\u201d Lady Vris stated boldly, clearly trying to cast the guilt of her charge over to the shining ones who had come to the aid of the champion.\n\nAgain, the court erupted into brief shouts, but this time it was more murmurs and spirited discussion \u2013 it seemed that the court had become divided. The Empress\u2019s expression soured, but she nodded none the less: \u201cI shall require a recess to review recordings of the pre-hunt introduction. Ish, have that ready for me in my chambers \u2013 as well as statements on why search and rescue was delayed\u201d\n\nLooking at the emperor, the empress nodded as if having heard words not spoken out loud. Turning to the court, the empress proclaimed: \u201cSeventeen minutes recess!\u201d\n\nFred couldn\u2019t quite remember how the shining one calendar and time system worked, but he had encountered the seventeen-minute thing before, and he knew that his implant was just translating their time units to his. As he looked on the empress rose from her throne and stepped onto a disc, flying off to somewhere else. That was when Lady Vris tugged at his armor: \u201cWhatever happens until she comes back, do NOT leave my side\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it that bad?\u201d\n\nLady Vris looked worried: \u201cBehind us, to our left, I\u2019ve counted at least six scions from house Emnui, the house of Lady K\u2019Vir. They\u2019ll want blood and probably won\u2019t mind violating protocol to get it\u201d\n\n\u201cHave they brought their champion?\u201d Fred wondered with a cheeky grin.\n\nThe look Fred got in return was not a pleased on, but Lady Vris none the less seemed aware of what Fred was talking about: \u201cDon\u2019t know \u2013 but they won\u2019t try to challenge you or demand a duel. I\u2019m more afraid that they\u2019ll want to poison or outright kill you. Usually, you get a servant to do the deed and make them take the blame\u201d\n\n\u201cLovely. I\u2019ll keep my armor on\u201d Fred said, looking around and seeing several groups of shining ones approaching: Some of them looked cheerful, some looked angry, others were difficult to read.\n\nThat was when the music started \u2013 well, sort of. Everyone seemed to turn to look, so Fred looked along as well: What sounded like a mix of cymbals, metallic drums and a lot of jingling metal bits turned out to be a small procession of shining ones clad in robes, each carrying a staff decorated with the gizmos making some of the sounds. They walked in a straight line towards Fred and Lady Vris, everyone parting way as they approached\u2026\n\n\u201cWho or what are these guys?\u201d Fred asked, but Lady Vris was doing her throat-baring bow already.\n\nThe hooded shining ones, their robes rippling with what looked like strange holographic embroidery, light dancing over the cloth in strange patterns that looked a bit like circuitry, only to fade and then trace a different path next, seemed quite strange \u2013 but nobody was trying to stop them as they approached.\n\n\u2026was this some kind to distraction to get close enough for a killing blow? Fred looked around, but nobody else seemed to be trying to sneak up on him.\n\nIn a stern and critical tone, the lead robed one held its staff up \u2013 it lit up with a bright white-blue light. All the shining ones in view bowed their heads, including Lady Vris: \u201cAre you the bringer of darkness?\u201d\n\nIt was pretty obvious that the shining one had asked Fred \u2013 and its voice sounded male \u2013 but what did the guy want with a question like that? Fred looked at Lady Vris, but she was too busy bowing her head.\n\nThe robed one struck his staff at Fred\u2019s chest armor, the staff and its jingling bits rattling against his chest plate: \u201cSavage, you will respond to my inquisition!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnswer him you idiot!\u201d Lady Vris sneered all the while still keeping her head down.\n\nFred perked an eyebrow, then he grabbed the staff and flung it to the side away from him: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m a bringer of darkness \u2013 you\u2019re going to have to be a little more specific\u201d\n\nShocked gasps and other similar outcries rang out from the thousands of onlookers, as if Fred had just taking a shit on the pope\u2019s shoes or something \u2013 but the robed one seemed to take it in stride, pulling the staff back and holding it by his side: \u201cThere is a prophecy: A bringer of darkness will the end the brightest light. It is written that it must be brought before the all-star, lest the light it ended be lost forever\u201d\n\nOk, with his smoke-screen armor Fred could easily see how he could be a \u2018bringer of darkness\u2019 \u2013 but some nonsense about someone\u2019s light? Was this some kind of requiem, or did these jokers want to sacrifice him to the \u2018Allstar\u2019 or something? \u201cRight \u2013 ok, I can see how you\u2019d think that\u2019d be me. But bringing me before the Allstar, how? Also, who are you guys?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are the clerics of the Allstar. We tend the to the spiritual needs of all shining ones and ensure our continued enlightenment through our communal connection to the Allstar. As for bringing you before the Allstar, then you will be brought to the nearest star-shrine. There is one two halls down from where we are now\u201d\n\nFred looked at Lady Vris \u2013 the way this cleric fellow was talking, then it really didn\u2019t sound like he was asking \u2013 but Fred wanted Lady Vris to to give her ok none the less. She quickly nodded, fervently so: \u201cGo, try to be back before the empress returns!\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright \u2013 lead the way\u201d Fred said, resigning himself to the fact that this crazy rollercoaster ride didn\u2019t look like it was ending any time soon.\n\nWalking off, Fred dreaded what might happened to Lady Vris while he wasn\u2019t there \u2013 it made him walk faster. The clerics just kept up with him, saying when to turn left or right.\n\nThe shrine was indeed very close by \u2013 though it wasn\u2019t exactly advertised as such. What looked like a supply closet door revealed a shrine decked out in plastic flowers and other lavish but clearly synthetic offerings, to the point that the piles of gifts and religious paraphernalia around the shrine itself reached the ceiling. Someone hadn\u2019t been cleaning this place up since\u2026 forever. It was also really strange since Fred hadn\u2019t seen anything like that on Lady Vris\u2019s ship, despite seeing her honor this clergy as an article of faith.\n\nThe central shrine itself looked to be a large metallic cube sitting or floating in a pool of silverlight fluid. Like the robes of the clerics, then lights travelled over the surface of the cube tracing what looked like impossibly intricate circuitry. Was this some kind of machine cult worshiping silverlight?\n\nFred was guided to stand before the pool, at which point the clerics all just up and left, not really explaining anything. This obviously confused Fred, because what the hell was he supposed to do? He hadn\u2019t been instructed to do anything specific, and he wasn\u2019t exactly feeling inclined to pray to the thing before him \u2013 so\u2026 now what?\n\nThat was when the floor under Fred melted in an instant, leaving him to fall into a dark void.",

            "selftext": "I recently went on a school trip to another city with my class. The trip itself was alright, but one thing that infuriated me was the behaviour of my peers. For context, we are all 16-18 years old.\n\nI just don't understand how they don't seem to be able to follow the simplest social rules, even though they are all neurotypical. I'm a special needs student (the only one in my class), yet I was the only one that knew, or at least followed rules like paying attention when our guide was talking, taking my hat off when entering churches, standing in line (more like trying to, because no one else bothered) when our teachers were doing a headcount and getting up and going to breakfast on time. I attend one of the better schools in my country, so this confuses me even more. \n\nI'm one of the few people in my school who actually follows the dress code, is respectful to the teachers and follows those unwritten social rules that some very nice people have written down in neat little guidebooks, that in my opinion everyone should read and internalise. \n\nI know how to tie a tie, what cutlery to use when and for what, what and how many flowers are appropriate in a situation, when to keep quiet and when to speak up, and much more. I know what to wear when and where, who to greet first, how to eat politely, how to talk to men and women alike and how to behave myself. \n\nMy peers know none of this, at least they don't seem to know. I feel like gen z and millenials are the rudest, dumbest, worst behaved people on planet earth, because they don't follow those rules.\n\nWhat irks me is that autistic people are thought of as socially inept, but I clearly am not, and this is not just a delusion of mine. My teachers notice this and often compliment me on that.\n\nWhy am I better at being a polite person than post neurotypical people my age, when the stereotype would suggest otherwise?\n\nThe worst thing is I actually had a nightmare where the people I was in the hotel room with called me a \"Karen\" and complained how they had to \"deal with my behaviour for three days\" and how I should \"feel lucky that someone even wanted to stay with me\". I know these are just my insecurities, but one shouldn't be insecure about my autism and how others perceive me.\n\nYes, from this post one might think I'm full of it, but I'm not. I try to be as polite as I can be and only expect from others what I would expect from myself.",

            "selftext": "Hi all, back with ranking results after a fantastic Britain's Strongest Man competition. The World's Strongest Man, European Strongest Man and reigning Britain's Strongest Man were all competing, with the competition going down to the final event, which Tom inevitably won and took the title. \n\nGraham Hicks took a superb third and added lots of ranking points to his currently meagre total. Great to see him picking up some good results, and even beating Luke to pick up more points. \n\nShane Flowers pickes up good points, and beat Paul Smith and Andy Black both ranked above him. Andy had a poor competition and didn't gain any ranking points. Finishing behind five athletes ranked below him wiped out the points from his disappointing 9th placed finish.\n\nTom now has 5/6 results counting towards his ranking total and overtakes JF (again) for 2nd place, and is only 177 points behind Oleksii. Bish moves back into the top 10 in 9th, and Luke retains 8th with a small points increase. Luke and Bish both have 6 results counting towards their totals, so will need to improve on those results in the remaining competitions this year to increase their totals.\n\nI can't wait for the Rogue Invitational!\n\n|Britains Strongest Man 2021 Ranking Points| | | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|Result|Athlete|Pre-Event Pts|New Points|Change|\n|1|Tom Stoltman|2779|3079|\u25b2 300|\n|2|Adam Bishop|1612|1865|\u25b2 253|\n|3|Graham Hicks|340|626|\u25b2 286|\n|4|Luke Stoltman|2056|2141|\u25b2 85|\n|5|Pa O'Dwyer|809|919|\u25b2 110|\n|6|Mark Felix|803|898|\u25b2 95|\n|7|Shane Flowers|0|122|\u25b2 122|\n|8|Paul Smith|120|216|\u25b2 196|\n|9|Andy Black|938|938|\u25ac|\n|10|Desmond Gahan|0||\u25b2 45|\n|The Strongest Ranker 2021\u200b| | | | |\n\n\n|Britains Strongest Man 2021 Ranking Changes| | | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|Result|Athlete|New Rank|Prev Ranking|Change|\n|1|Tom Stoltman|2|3|\u25b2 1|\n|2|Adam Bishop|9|12|\u25b2 3|\n|3|Graham Hicks|28|47|\u25b2 19|\n|4|Luke Stoltman|8|8|\u25ac|\n|5|Pa O'Dwyer|17|20|\u25b2 3|\n|6|Mark Felix|19|21|\u25b2 2|\n|7|Shane Flowers|91|X|\u25b2 X|\n|8|Paul Smith|67|94|\u25b2 27|\n|9|Andy Black|16|16|\u25ac|\n|10|Desmond Gahan|165|X|\u25b2 X|\n|The Strongest Ranker 2021\u200b| | | | |\n\n\n|Top 10 World Ranking| | | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|Ranking|Athlete|Total Pts|Prev.

            "selftext": "I was thinking of creating a version of quidditch in minecraft with elytra. Yes, that game from Harry Potter than everyone loves. So if you don't what it is, then search it up, it's relatively simple, maybe. The golden snitch would be either a baby bee with swiftness (and maybe invisibility but that may be too hard) or a bat with swiftness. The bludger which follows players around trying to knock them off their broom, but in this case kill them and they respawn, would be a phantom and the beaters have a knockback II wooden sword to try and stop them from attacking their players. The quaffle would be a snowball and the player has to throw the snowball in the rings past the keepers. You may be thinking? How would stealing work. Each player will be hit with a poison potion to be on half a heart, so the opponent just has to hit the player and take his snowball. The player will respawn on the bed he sets his spawn point to before the game and then hit with another poison potion by a dispenser, if keep inventory is not on, a dispensor will also give him elytra and fireworks, and he will be pushed out back into the match. Now the keepers, their job is the easiest just fly by their rings stop the snowballs from getting in with their bodies. If the golden snitch is a bee with invisibility or swiftness then the seeker will have to be holding flowers and once they feed the bee, it means they caught it and the game ends plus 150 points. There would also be fouls, like spawn killing players, players killing the keepers, yeah.",
