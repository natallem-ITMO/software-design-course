            "selftext": "I had this officer aggressively ask me if I had any booze. He asked four times over our like half hour of back and fourth. Took longer because he had to call his superior which took longer. First cop wrote me a drunk driving ticket and a reckless driving moving violation ticket (because I drove weird behind him, i made a wide weird turn.) \n\nIt was 2 am and I memorable recall driving write behind him, obviously super cautious as one wants to be behind a cop for a few turns, like it could look like I was tailing him.\n\nBut on the last turn I made he pulled a Uwee u turn and now was behind me. Me being like oh fuck since my windshield and mirror are flashing red yet relieved cause I knew I did not do anything.\n\nBad first impressions... he came up behind me with his flashlight and lit up my late uncle's hunting knife I had tucked behind my drivers seat. Asked me about that. \n\nAssured him that it was under the legal limit of blade length, or so I thought. I bluffed kinda cause I wasn't sure if it was exactly under 4 and a half inches (yes, my state is super lame, in the city nearest me it is even stricter and I shit you not this has happened:\n\nhandyman physical labor person on the subway with his tool belt. Officer sees what his tool prove to be (probable cause to search? Fuck no. just like the cop who asked me if I drank 4 times even after I offered to blow a breathalyzer. He asked if I was willing. I was. Prepared to blow it but he never even took it out, went back to his sherlock homes interrogations. But back to the worker in NYC subway who also didn't grant officer probable cause, the cop detained and seized his tools, all legal seeming. But he had an exacto knife.\n\nDont know if you are familiar with how those work but they are good handy and have reservoir blades in case the tip breaks. While only a inch or two when used, the blade can stretch out far if you were tp push the mechanism all the way forward. So it technically was a OTF of half a foot. Went to jail. Possesion of an illegal weapon being openly carried which makes it worse as it seeable is another crime.\n\nRidiculous right? i used exacto knife in art school that were like scalpels, only razor blades can you properly sharpen a pencil. A free hand razor. I've amused myself before by using a standard combat knife to get the job done. Anyway, the scalpel type I had in school exacto is more dangerous than the typical exacto. (Or I'll put it like this, if I had to fight to the death I'd choose the one I carried in HS to etch the Pieta in plastic. (bringing Jesus to liberal art school's art is much fun believe, they hate the classical and especially the Christian kind. I could etch David and Moses, maybe even Allah (which is no kosher/haram) and it would be applauded. \n\nAnyway I carry on with the officer painfully wrong, conversational loops and finally the superior arrives. He talks to me for like 20 minutes or more (waits until my parents can come pick me up because even though they had no proof I drank, the first officer gave him reasonable doubt. I had a very articulate convo with the cool cop as his beta boy beat it. Talked to the cool cop about music which eventually led to how my favorite band is his daughters fav, how they have seen \"Tool\" together. We clicked and Im sure I sounded articulate.\n\nEnough so that he ripped both tickets in half in front of us all, he saw my very non offensive White Parents who are quite polite, ma sevred the CIA for 15 years, Daddy did the whole Camel Joe Camel cash thing meaning we were well off enough to be all well dressed, button up shirts opposed ti ghetto Fuck the Police Graphic tees.\n\nCool cop. Got driven home. My parents happy I called them because the only other choice (which I did ask for since I wanted to drive home) would be taking a ride with them to the police station. Not arrested idont think but Detained, yeah that is the word.\n\nOh yeah tho,  have an anxiety disorder,, ocd etc.and at the time did have medication in my blood. None of them you can't drive on technically, but it is a grey area when it comes to Xanax. Night drives relax me as does it so I used to have that pre sleep tradition. I had 3mg of the stuff in me which would equate to the average person being on 0.5 or less. Genetic and learnt tolerance is key. I remember last time I was hospitalized for rhabdo, the nurses scared if I was a fall risk. First night they didnt even give me the typical doese prescribed my a Dr. who works in a far more prestigious hospital: one under Columbia where he's the head of multiple departments. Handsome black man who outranked my hot nurses I liked and the ugly female dr.s I called nurses on purpose (jk, no lol, but the first asian bitch upon hearin my dose said no, you must be confused.That's not how that works, is against hospital rules. Not her jurisdiction at all and even I was better read when it came to anxiolytic dosing, potency and power.\n\nYea, beech if you were to take that much you'd look like you were date rape drugged. Despite the \"fall risk\" the cool nurse in the nightshift and I would walk the corridors, me connected to my IV machine, taking turns pushin it around. She was older but very hot. Shower misunderstanding (i asked her how to turn the water on as it was jammed and she came in and said \"oh I can't be in here at the same time\" but I said no, I just cant get the water flowing. Bare in mind I'm half dressed and we both wait for the water to pour, \"I can't shower with you though to be clear\" of course i said as we waited for the water to run. Few minutes before it ran, worked she and I stood silently semi awardly. Look to her while shirtless and both technically in the shower together, she gives me these eyes and a smile, smile I did too considering the situation was funny. Both of her where in their long enough to look weird. \n\nFinally left and I took off my undies, her last expression being that of the girl tiger from the Lion king, the queen. of simba i think or his dad.\n\nWell, such was seered into my memory and even though it was night 3 there I still had yet to tend to my you know what. Didnt in the shower, the door couldn't lock. But that look had me pulling an emergency mastubation sesh, one hand on the door pulling it closed the whole time, the other getting out the energy that was gonna be bad the next day for the female Dr. had to touch my stomach and dront side of kidneys, I had kidney failure. and simple touch to such area sends blood to the groin area no matter what. A simple touch of the inner thigh will make lady or guy have their blood pool downstairs automatically. Was awkward my face when the Dr. Rubbed my chest and belly, arms muscles because she had to know how they were healing because I had muscle death via over lifting. Anyway, I still think she knew I was enjoying the touch and on the verge of not simple going from a quarter chub.\n\nThe end. Essential workers am i right?\n\nGeorge Floyd would have gotten a Lollipop if he were in the ER over Fentanyl OD\n\n4real. Chavuin or whatever the take a knee for the national anthem is a Dolt, and to assure you I am part of the unwashed masses: Rittenhouse did nothing wrong, mostly. Typically in such a situation you want to aim more center mass, do a tripple tap, tap put joe rogan 2 leg take down style. Ive trained and lived by the blade (way of the Samurai) but shot lil boy 22lrs better than my half on pot half on muscle relaxers boyscout group; personally I would have brough a Ruger PC carbine chambered in 9mm opposed to an Armalite 556 ar. 556 doesn't have hollow point potential. 9mm def do, less recoil, lighter more modular, less likely to over penetrate and hit a bystander Plus it shrapnels far much more than a 556. Ya know what, never mind. 10mm, no wait Five-Seven: compensates for loss of velocity.

            "selftext": "Link to my first post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/qe3ybz/its_time_to_get_out_of_the_closet_and_search_for/).\n\nMy journey of life had been absolutely turbulent and many things, significant or not, would eventually make me become what I am now. This post right here is to share my story in the hopes that maybe someone out there could at least just listen, it helps too. If someone could relate towards my story, even at just a tiny section, that would actually make me happy (for once).\n\n***Some notes to consider:***\n\n* I am from Asia (still hesitant to name country because of its laws) and therefore the culture is different and is also where anything LGBTQ+ is considered illegal or immoral much more compare to the West.\n* I am actually on the autism spectrum but I don't think it really influenced my sexuality and gender.\n* I am going to break down my story into categories so that it's easier to sort out. It's just really a me thing.\n\n**The most of my childhood part that doesn't have much to list out**\n\nGenerally, I was raised as a male and taught to think and act as a male. I had never questioned it because I never really thought about it myself. If I would do anything that is out of the gender norm, I would be swiftly corrected.\n\nEven so, I just want to point out some lil' tidbits here and there that may be considered feminine.\n\n* I played with dolls and dollhouses with my sister when I was 6, probably just having fun with her.\n* Whenever a TV show aimed at little girls was airing, I for some reason never switch channels and ended up a bit invested in the show.\n* I lost my last friend (who's a female) at age 9 because I did a feminine act without realizing that it was feminine. She would afterwards become one of my bullies.\n* At age 11, I read a comic about a boy attempting to be more muscular and tough ended up transforming into a female by eating the wrong cake. Somehow, I thought that it was possible to magically change gender in a poof like that, which oddly made me questioned what made me a male. That thought process suddenly disappeared a week later.\n\n**Founding out LGBTQ+ via um.... p\\*rn? Was underage as well, that means guilty as charged :(**\n\nI stumbled onto something rather suggestive back then where you got really sexy girls enacting certain fetishes (I wouldn't go into detail about them). As expected for a straight male back then, I got hooked. Then I continued watching even more, eventually stumbling upon the gay and lesbian part of it. It's from there I discovered that LGBTQ+ is a thing and my opinion about them back then was basically... eh.\n\nI would say the first major sign about my feminine side came from here, in which I wondered about the experience of the girls rather than wanting such a girl for myself. This thought process made me try to reenact the sexual act in my head and ended up feeling what the girl felt like. I didn't feel disgusted but instead enjoyed it. It definitely wasn't the same when it comes to guys in p\\*rn though. It never stick out in my mind for a long time until I started to question about my own individuality.\n\n**Depression and dislike towards masculinity**\n\nAt age 16, I was suddenly no longer \"naive\" and sort of jump to conclusion on why people just keep bullying me (almost my entire age group which is about a 100 people were bullying me since age 13, most of them being lied to and influenced by just one jock group of 8, and I never dared to speak up). My conclusion was basically these people are just evil and get their pleasure by torturing me. It made me a misanthrope. Life on the internet (which was kind of a last resort) wasn't much better because I would get cyberbullied by toxic people. All of them had made me hating life so badly that I entered my worst time of my life.\n\nDuring my depression, I was hyper-aware about very toxic comments because they just stir that torturous anger within me. It was around here I noticed some similar patterns within these users and the bullies in school, in which they just mock and insult anyone who were deemed weak and nerdy. They also gave off a very \"Look at my muscles and body. You will never be a tough badass man like me\" vibes. I would eventually learn that it was toxic masculinity but many had justified it as a common thing a male would do and you wouldn't be a proper male if you don't follow this path.\n\nI hated it. I hated that it was a requirement to be this type of a person to be a male. I was ashamed. Ashamed of my very own gender for behaving this way. I thought that if these were the requirements to be a male, I'd rather not be one. I'd rather die than to become the type of people that bullied me.\n\n**An unexpected attraction towards an OC**\n\nI had multiple characters created in my head for my fantasy world since age 10. One of the characters would eventually be feminized for the sake of fetishes because... my brain just did that. That being said, he was still male, just rather femboyish. At age 18, I for some reason felt attraction towards him, despite knowing he was male. It would later on be the source of my sexuality dysphoria 2 years later.\n\n**Career choice, paranoid about blackmails, new identity required**\n\nJust before hitting depression, I had thoughts about becoming a gaming Youtuber but that dark part of my life would have set it aside. At age 19, as my depression became slightly milder and as I learnt more about society around me, I was much more self-aware about myself and started thinking about my career again but also found out some really serious problems. My depression which caused a very nasty and toxic attitude plus my previously very poor reputation in school could kill my career before it began. I thought that all it would took was for one of them to reveal what I was in school and for the rest to believe it and hurl abuse towards me.\n\nThe only solution I thought of was to kill my old self and restart life as a new person, by taking on an entirely new identity with no connection to the past. What eventually pushed for it was when my mother called me a demon due to my horrible behavior.\n\n**New me but not really me**\n\nAt age 20, I decided to see a psychologist, mostly with the intention to find out about my mental disorders. But thanks to his help, I managed to change to a new identity.\n\nThat being said, this identity was slightly less masculine than previous because of how badly I vowed to not be like my bullies. Nonetheless, I was excited. Finally, I could pursue my career as I had ever wanted... for only few months.\n\nCOVID happened. Then, lockdowns happened. I thought I wouldn't be affected because I don't go out anyways but it did, mainly because of my parents. Due to personal requirements, there were sort of in the way. So, I resorted to secretly read smut and other stories instead.\n\nFunnily enough, these reading materials would inspire me to create a philosophy regarding one's individuality. That's where I discovered that I wasn't really being me. I was simply being an idealistic individual for the career and that's where the dysphoria started piling up.\n\n**Dysphoria, dysphoria, dysphoria**\n\nI would say it's the NSFW materials that keep giving me all the dysphoria. All those girls having fun yet I couldn't be like them. More and more, I started copying them (only poses and movement) and taking good looks at myself. I thought if I ever had dysphoria if any, it would be weak, but I was wrong. The more I develop my sense of self, the more I desire to not be masculine, which defaulted to being feminine, simply because for whatever the reasons were, it just felt right.\n\nWhat I keep seeing in the mirror, what I sound like in a recording, it just ain't me at all. It's that guy (old self) that shouldn't exist anymore. It's ugly and unfitting. If things keep going like this, how am I supposed to continue my career?\n\n**The final straw**\n\nA few months ago, I have been interested in role-playing and found out about a recent trend in which many Twitch streamers plus few big TikTokers and Youtubers were playing in a role-playing server. I binge watched whatever was going on in the server and found out multiple things.\n\nThere are multiple transfemale streamers that have lots of views and subs role-playing a female character successfully in the server. There are also a few circle groups there that I personally wish to be part of because I felt like I belong there. Some of the streamers even evoked my gender envy, but most importantly my voice dysphoria.\n\nFrom there, I had enough. I should just stop and move on, by being a whole new person that really is me - a transfemale, pursuing the career I had always wanted.\n\n**The current situation**\n\nSo... I only just decided to begin a new life as a girl, but without support from anyone IRL. That's why I am here, hoping to find someone willing to give me their support and advice.\n\nIf I happen to say anything offensive, pls pls do point out and forgive me because I am new, so in advance: ***I am so so sorry...***\n\nIf you had read my entire long story, I could only say: ***THANK YOU!!! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU! &lt;3***",

            "selftext": "I don't think I have ever had a real friend.  I thought people were my friend but it was only because of what I could do for them money, drugs, transportation, etc. I wasted the best years of my life with these people only to find out they would not even take a few minutes out of their day to help me or think of me. I didn't even matter to them.  I had to take care of myself alone. I had to do anything I wanted to experience alone.  Yet I was always expected to be their mother basically and I ran their life and mine. \n\nI don't use social media because I think the goverment cares what I say or do it's because literally no one will accept my friend requests. It was so embarrassing to try Facebook or Myspace which had the top 8.  I was in no one's top 8 even the person I thought was my best friend in the entire world. Like he meant so much to me and I might not even be alive now if I didn't think I had him as a kid.  But looking back he never even got me a birthday or Christmas present even though I always did for him. I was so naive I thought maybe that does not happen in real life. I see people do it on TV but that's not real.  He would not even come to my house. \n\nReddit is my only way to interact with the world and all I do is make people angry on here. Even when I think I'm asking simple questions or making good observations they don't hear what I say.  I feel like I come across like an asshole.  They say mean things I get mean back. I can't do it anymore. I want to delete my account and myself. \n\nI'm on the spectrum and I think that is why. People have told me I write in a really strange way and mock me for it.  You probably don't even understand this even though it seems so clear to me.  They said I had a high IQ in school and English professors in school said I was a good writer but I guess that does not matter. \n\nI don't care if I get sick and die. I'm not gonna like get a gun or something tonight but I can't try anymore. I thought maybe if I got a pet I would have some companionship and a reason to live because who will take care of my dog and they will love me.  I can't even convince a shelter to give me a dog because I am such a fuck up. I wish I could trade places with some dying kid in a hospital. Someone who has people who care. Someone who has a future.  All I do is sit alone in my house and no one cares. I just don't see a point. I try to so hard to find the good in life and there is just none for me anymore. \n\nI just want to buy some heroin and OD.  It would be peaceful.  With my luck I would survive and become addicted but maybe that is a risk  I should take.",

            "selftext": "Let me specify and apologies for my wonky grammar or words of choice - I don't know why but I'm scared.\n\nSo. I think I have adhd. It would explain so much to me about my past actions and why I would be the way I am. \n\nYou see, I try to strive to become better overall to combat my depression. But I can't. E.g I want to study but I procrastinate. I try to stick to working out, but I can't be bothered. I've been thinking of buying a mirror to try motivate me for results.\n\nAnd just recently I saw a reel on instagram about adhd awareness and these symptoms that I can identify with and they were word for word:\n\nChronic People Pleasing, Emotional dysregulation, Impulsive thrill seeking and imposter syndrome.\n\nI have all these (in my self diagnosis) in varying levels.\n\nY'see I didn't have the brightest childhood, if I can even call it a childhood. Emotionally and sometimes physically abusive 'parents'. Manipulative for sure and with  constant guilt tripping to keep me in line. And I blame them for most things, which is probably unhealthy. But I'd like to think I'm allowed to since I'm a 'victim'. \n\nI'm not trying to mock victims, but to me, I don't even feel like one. I know for sure, what they did to me was abusive and that I would've killed myself if it meant I could finally be at peace.\n\nWhen I mess up, I always jump to suicide. I remember thinking \"If someone tells me to do so, I would.\" No one has told me to do it yet. But nevertheless I have tried. I said \"I'll try and if I fail, I'll live it out.\" But I always think about it. And it's stupid. \n\nFor instance I don't wake up on time and miss something important. I'll think, \"You could've woken up on time, but oh no, you wanted to be lazy and now you're facing the consequences. You know what, you should end it.\"\n\nAnother time, I impulsively punched a wall. I was not angry. I just wanted to know what it'd feel like to have a broken bone. I didn't even bat an eye to the possible consequences. And every time someone reminds me of it. I cringe.\n\nThis is partially because, whenever I do something stupid. I have to process it. If I don't, I spiral real quick and contemplate s/h and suicide. I'll think:\n\n\"why did you do that, that was fucking stupid of you\"\n\"you should've known better idiot\"\n\"now your life is ruined and you can't fix it all because of you and your stupid impulse\" \n\nAnd from there it gets worse and my thoughts suggest that I just do it. Getting reminded of it isn't very fun.\n\nIt doesn't make any sense to me. Nothing does. Everyday I feel hollow and I don't remember much. But on random days I'll tear up and cry for hours on end and think it'd better to just die. It's hard to see the good things when your vision is clouded with sadness and anger.\n\nI'm scared of being diagnosed with adhd because although I'd gain so much closure, it'd be hard to accept. People already make fun of others for being the way they are and I don't want to be a target for more negative things. \n\nI'll be fine when my mind has cleared. I hope.\n\nIf you got this far, thank you for reading. This was mainly to get this off my chest, typing it out helps me process things. If you have suggestions on what I should do to help me - please comment, I'll welcome them all.",

            "selftext": "We have often read on this sub that if your try telling about SR to your friends and peers they may laugh at you , mock you , ridicule you. So it's better to keep it to yourself.\n\nWhy is this so? \n\nMost people in today's world associate themselves with their accumulations - be it money be intelligence , good looks , property , money , name , fame , social status , relationships etc. THEY think these various things which they have gathered are THEY.  Surely your accumulations are YOURS but they certainly not YOU. Not even your body or mind is you. If you still think they they are you then you are nothing but living in an illusion. In yogic parlance this can be loosely called as Maya. \n\nBut when you fail to get these accumulations for  whatever reasons (relative to your expectations) , we can say that you are disillusioned, disillusioned with life and things around you. When this disillusion happens , the illusion breaks automatically. And when illusion breaks , the reality becomes visible. And only then you become open for things like SR. From a hard rock you have become clay , so now water can seep in effortlessly. Why? Because now your receptivity is much higher.  The mirror has been wiped out clean  and now you have started to see things more clearly.\n\nThat's why we see many people have started SR when they were going through one of their lowest phases of life. \n\nActually it was nothing special , it's just that they got disillusioned and broke the veil of Maya (unkowningly) ! \ud83d\ude00\n\nCongrats , Congrats ! !",
