            "selftext": "&gt; [He who controls the language controls the masses.](https://patriotmusic.com/control-the-language-control-the-masses/)\n\n&gt; **Saul Alinsky, Rules for Radicals**\n\nI was reminded of this quote by [Grace on Twitter](https://twitter.com/graceisforyou/status/1451653296993624067), who provided several examples of language-warping which could lead to really serious consequences. She also said:\n\n&gt; Refuse their vocab. It's modern day spell-casting. Make them agree with you to define terms or don't have the 'conversation.'\n\nThis advice reflects her own experience in \"the fire\", when \"woke\" employees of the non-profit she and her husband started attempted to wrest control of the nonprofit organization from them by accusing them of racist abuse of the people they were helping.\n\nShe prevailed in that situation partly by taking her own advice above.\n\nBut in politics, there is a second problem, which is getting them to a place where they reveal what they mean by their language, instead of just clamming up.\n\nThis brings us to Ace's big stories from yesterday:\n\nEmails Reveal that [National School Board Association Colluded With White House](http://ace.mu.nu/archives/396126.php) To Draft That Letter Demanding the DOJ Treat Concerned Parents as \"Domestic Terrorists\"\n\n&gt; New reporting suggests that the National School Board Association colluded with the Biden White House regarding their letter demanding that the FBI treat critics of leftwing schoolboards as potential domestic terrorists.\n\nThis is key:\n\n&gt; The left-wing education company co-founded by Merrick Garland's son-in-law used a training session for teachers focused on \"systemic racism,\" recommending an article that referred to Trump rally-goers as \"examples of white supremacy\" akin to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\n&gt; Panorama Education, co-founded by Xan Tanner, who is the group's president, claims it has made its way into thousands of schools in the U.S., selling race-focused student and teacher surveys and conducting training on systemic racism and oppression, white supremacy, unconscious or implicit bias, and intersectionality, all under the rubric of \"Social-Emotional Learning.\" The company makes it clear that \"SEL\" is just a \"vehicle\" for achieving its goals related to \"equity.\"\n\n*Social-emotional learning.*\n\nAnd there's this:\n\nLuke Rosiak: [The Loudoun County School Board Knew All About the Sexual Assault In Their Schools' Bathroom](http://ace.mu.nu/archives/396136.php#396136); They Were Informed Of It The Day They Happened\n\n&gt; But they lied about when asked by the *father of the girl who'd been r4ped*.\n\nGarland did not do well when questioned about this case.\n\nLearning to deal with people like the father of a girl who has been r4ped, used as an example of a domestic terrorist in a letter you received, is not his idea of \"social-emotional learning\". Apparently.\n\nBits of positive news: [17 state AGs](https://www.dailywire.com/news/17-state-ags-condemn-doj-targeting-school-board-meetings-trying-to-chill-lawful-dissent-by-parents) have condemned the DOJ targeting of school board meetings. (old news) And FINALLY, the National School Board Association [has apologized for their letter.](https://twitter.com/NoahPollak/status/1451705222531674112) (new news).\n\n**So, what qualifies as \"social-emotional learning\"?**\n\nMany local and state school boards require teaching children something along these lines. But what does it mean? As Grace says,\n\n&gt; Make them agree with you to define terms \n\nYou are in a position to force the conversation. **Remember that.**\n\nWhat does your school board think social emotional learning is?\n\n*Getting along with the kids in your first grade class?*\n\nMaybe. If you send the details to Panorama. Along with a description of your interactions with your family.\n\n*Civics?*\n\nNo. Social activism for leftist organizations? Probably.\n\n*Does child pornography qualify?*\n\nYes! [Librarians agree!](https://thechalkboardreview.com/latest/libraries-promote-horrific-content)\n\n[Here](https://www.facebook.com/utahparentsunited/videos/402697221346835), a purchased, copyrighted SEL program teaches 13 year old kids how to have a variety of sexual experiences, and to become [enthusiastic blabbermouths](https://www.utahparentsunited.org/sel.html#/) about those experiences.\n\n**Know any kids? You may wish to investigate what they are being taught.** by Merrick Garland's son-in-law and others in similar businesses which contract with school districts. The schools themselves should not be free from scrutiny.\n\nAs an aside, the [United States Conference of Mayors](https://twitter.com/MythinformedMKE/status/1451676925878063106) has released a detailed position piece in support of teaching critical race theory in K-12 schools.\n\nAlso,\n\n**How did we get to a place where the President, Attorney General and National School Board Association work together to label parents at school board meetings as \"domestic terrorists\"?** Braenyard had a clue last week:\n\n\n&gt; \"No one worried about the weaponization of government.\" So, we went right from the nefarious legacy of John Brennan (who lied under oath to Congress twice),\n\n&gt; James Clapper (who lied under oath to Congress once), James Comey (who leaked confidential presidential memos), Andrew McCabe (who gave false testimony to federal investigators),\n\n&gt; Lisa Page (who was fired from the special counsel's legal team for various unprofessional conduct),\n\n&gt; Peter Strzok (about whom there is not enough space to detail his transgressions), and the now convicted felon Kevin Clinesmith onto the next round of impeachments.\n\nThey feel impervious to consequences. With good reason.\n\nFrom Not the Bee, [Watch the President of the United States mock the word \"Freedom\".](https://notthebee.com/article/watch-the-president-of-the-united-states-literally-mock-the-word-freedom) \n\ncourtesy of [Ace of Spades](https://ace.mu.nu/)",

            "selftext": "[https://randommathgenerator.com/2021/10/24/nash-equilibria-in-human-relationships/](https://randommathgenerator.com/2021/10/24/nash-equilibria-in-human-relationships/)  \n\n\n*A* [*Nash equilibrium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) *is a state of equilibrium between two parties in which one only party changing their behavior will not make things better for that party. It will require both parties to change their behavior simultaneously to make things better for both.*\n\nIt might surprise the reader to know that the author of this blog has had some experience with societal relationships; even some with the opposite gender. My college girlfriend and I started on a good note, and then due to mistakes made with time, things became more complex. Towards the end of our relationship, we settled upon an equilibrium in which we were both rude, uncompromising and unhelpful towards each other. Let me try and explain why this was a Nash equilibrium.\n\nWhen one of us would feel bad about how things had turned out, and would try to be nicer so as to turn back time and return to how things were, the other would be unaware of such intentions, and only mock the other person for being fake and artificial. This would, of course, anger the person with good intentions, and we would both return to being terrible to each other. Note how one person trying to change their behavior for the better only made things worse for that person (invited accusations of insincerity). This is why this was a (bad) Nash equilibrium. A bad Nash equilibrium is caused by a lack of coordination. If both parties agreed that things had taken a turn for the worse, and that they had to change together for things to become better, there could perhaps be some hope.\n\nI see relationships at bad Nash equilibria all around me. My extended family is often at bad Nash equilibria with one another. Many members of my extended family are not nice to each other during family functions, and one member unilaterally trying to make things better by being nicer or more helpful almost always invites only suspicion or derision from others (\u201cWhy is s/he suddenly being so nice? What is the point of this fake gesturing?\u201d) This of course causes that one member to lose steam, and the state of affairs to return to the previous bad Nash equilibrium in which everyone is terrible to each other.\n\n## Any way out?\n\nIs there any way out of bad Nash equilibria? One way of course is to tell everyone about your intentions. If you want things to become better between you and your family members, you should tell them that you want to try and become nicer to them so that things may become better with time, and that this bad Nash equilibrium was only hurting everyone. This may convince them to also be nicer to you, and soon things may turn for the better. But is it as easy as that?\n\nThe sad news is that two parties being good to each other is not a Nash equilibrium. If you and your friend are good and helpful to each other, and you decide to become inconsiderate and unhelpful while your friend remains good to you, you are of course at an advantage. You can take all the help you need from them, while being rude and dismissive towards them. This is why two people being nice to each other is not a stable state of affairs, as one is always tempted to defect (stop being nice). Similarly, if you and your romantic partner decide to be nicer to one another, as soon as you have an argument in which you try to prove your moral superiority, the person who brings up old issues to prove that they have historically been morally superior to the other will be at a temporary advantage in the argument. This of course causes the other person to bring up other old issues as well to prove their own moral superiority, and soon both parties return to the previous state of bad Nash equilibrium.\n\n## Money is always the answer\n\nIs there any hope? I\u2019d like to believe that there is some. If you and your partner are in a bad Nash equilibrium, you need to realize that being good to each other for the long term is a very difficult thing to achieve (it is not a Nash equilibrium), and that a single argument may send things hurtling down towards the bad Nash equilibrium (being terrible to one another). Hence, you need to resolve your old issues if there is to be any hope. But how does one do that? The answer to that is money (and my baniya-ness is only partly the reason why I came up with this explanation).\n\nSuppose there was an incident in the past that causes you both to keep bringing it up and fighting about it. If you both blame each other (and both of you probably are to blame), you are only talking past each other without any hope for reconciliation. What you need to decide is *how much* both of you are to blame. You may come up with something like you were 7/10 to blame, and you partner was 3/10 to blame (this of course assumes that both of you are still cooperative enough to agree on these numbers). Both of you have concluded that you were more to blame. Now you can decide upon a monetary fine, depending upon your financial condition. Something in the range of \\~$50 is reasonable if the issue involved is small, while larger amounts may be appropriate for more serious issues. Suppose you guys decide on a fine of $60. Transfer this amount to your partner. In my experience, this ends the issue then and there. If your partner ever comes up with this issue again in a future argument, you can remind them that you\u2019ve paid your dues, and then they\u2019ll have to switch to another issue in their search for moral superiority. Of course, if you\u2019ve done this for every serious issues that you\u2019ve had, there will be no other issues to go back to, and it will be easier to be nice to one another.\n\nCan you do the same with relatives/co-workers who you are in a bad relationship with? I believe that you can. However, it will be harder to get them to the drawing board to sort these issues out. Your uncle who you\u2019re in a bad Nash equilibrium with may not agree to go out for dinner with you to sort your old issues out. Even if he does agree to this meeting, he may be insulted if you ask him to assess his blame for any of your issues. If you have relatives like that, with whom there is a power differential, realizing that things are not going to get better is the only way out. However, there is hopefully no power differential between you and your partner, and you can mutually agree to sort out your issues using this method.\n\nPerhaps the reason why people are (generally) bad to each other in this world is that being bad to one another is a stable Nash equilibrium, while being good is not. Thus ends my spiel on applying Nash\u2019s rich and complex Game Theory in an overly simplistic way to our daily lives; with some buzzwords wrapped in a platitude.",

            "selftext": "If you have not read the [prologue](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/qdsvs3/return_to_monke_prologue/) yet, it's recommended that you do for some context.\n\n:------------------------------------------------||------------------------------------------------:\n\nMadam Besvakki waddled across the carpet, recently laid down over the rented hangar floor aboard the station. Say what you will, but let there be none whom ever accuses her for not going the extra mile to make her customers feel pampered. She had inherited her matriarch's wealth, but also her sense of business ethics. A happy customer is a returning customer.\n\nShe was considered quite short for a Daguun, barely 15 feet tall and weighing a mere 2 tons. If someone had simply heard those measurements, they would assume her to be sickly, or an adolescent, barely 2/3 the size of most Daguunae - but she was an absolute tank of a woman. Muscular quadrupedal legs carried her jiggling form towards the small crowd that had gathered around the latest spectacle in her \"shop\" - which was the entire hangar at this point.\n\n\"No way!\" A small Islanii hatchling uttered, her beaked face pressed against the polycarbonate window of the enclosure. \"Can we get one?!\" It asked with twinkles in it's eyes, looking up at it's mother who was almost as spellbound by the creatures before them.\n\nBesvakki suppressed a snicker as she realized that even with her thumping steps, she apparently had managed to *'sneak'* up on the crowd that had gathered around the latest addition to her already unrivaled selection of exotic pets; the elusive Alaian Tree Burrower. Absolutely adorable things - about 20 cm tall furred balls with 6 stumpy little legs that ended in dexterous manipulators built for climbing the massive trees of Alai, making nests near the top and protecting them from pests by catching and eating them with their long sticky tongues.\n\n\"There's a two-for-one special on them\\~\" She sang, causing half the crowd to flinch as her voice reverberated out. Oh dear, she forgot that the smaller species were a bit more sensitive to sound than she was.\n\nTheir shocked voices had apparently woken up the human that had been napping on her back, since she felt it climb up onto her impressive shoulders, coming into her peripheral view and peered down curiously at the crowd, making the cutest little chirping sounds. Mikaela's orange locks obscured most of her face, but Besvakki knew that she had the tell-tale intense looks she got when she suspected that she would get head pats and backrubs from the many younglings in the crowd that were currently giving her their attention, much to her delight.\n\n\"Sorry, Mikki.\" The madam cooed and gave the poor dear a bop on the nose with her primary finger. \"But we're still on the clock and you know - no messing about when mommy is working.\" she mock-chided the little human who huffed dramatically and flopped down to lie across her shoulder. She knew this was just an act, one she knew well enough to ignore. You can't let a human think they can charm you, or they'll never stop making demands. It took patience and a strong will to handle them, but it payed off if you knew how to handle them.\n\nShe was about to continue her sales pitch when a commotion ruined the serene moment she had created when Eflaso, the Valden quartermaster sprinted over on all fours and nearly crashed into her rear. This caused Mikki to stir and Besvakki had to grab her to stop her from pouncing on Eflaso out of instinct. Seriously, why were simians so skittish?\n\n\"I'm sorry ma'am - but it's as we suspec-\" He was promptly cut off by Besvakki's knowing expression and subtle tap of her left hind leg against the floor. Shei turned back to the crowd and gave them a winning smile. \"Sorry about that. Tix?\" The elderly Toani that stood leaned against the side of the enclosure, lazily tapping away on a PGC snapped to attention and walked over.\n\n\"Yes ma'am?\" She inquired, hunched slightly. She was in her later years, but still spry and blatantly refused to retire despite her age. Even her proboscis had scrumpled up into what looked like a wrinkly ball between her eyes and mouth. Bless her chitin.\n\n\"I need to see to this situation. Could you bring out the grubs? It's feeding time and I think the little ones might like to feed the Burrowers. Right kids?\" At that, the younglings started hopping up and down in excitement, accompanied by amused sounds from the older members of the crowd. Oh yeah, she was good at this. With that, she turned around and walked over to the gate to her section of the station, Eflaso in tow.\n\n\"So, you're sure about this?\" She asked Eflaso, gently rubbing her digits across Mikaela's scalp, ruffling her hair but receiving happy snorts and chirps in return from the human that was curled up in her palm. \"That idiot actually thinks I won't do anything about it?\"\n\nEflasso shrugged and leaned against a large metal crate. \"I'm afraid so. He apparently mistook your patience for naivete, or worse - weakness.\" He growled, tail flicking back and forth with disdain. \"He seems to think that he can keep delaying the payment for both the pet food **and** the toys!\"\n\nThe Madam was silent for a bit, then looked down at the little darling that had wrapped her arms and legs around her hand that had been petting her, nuzzling her stocky fingers. A smirk came across Besvakki's wide face.\n\n\"Eflasso. Would you fetch Simon for me? Then head over to LogSec and tell chief Prekk that I'm collecting on that favor in bay 12 in 30 minutes.\" She smiled down at Mikaela who tilted her head curiously to the familiar tone that Besvakki had used.\n\nA predatory grin came over the Valden's face. \"Yes ma'am!\"\n\n**1 hour later...** \n\n\"What in the void do you mean?!\" Captain Gremle screeched, sending spittle in the face of the Chief of Security, the now very tired and disinterested Prekk. The captain looked like he had been in a fight with an adult Fexis. Clothes were torn, his trunk had been tied in a knot around his head and his ship looked even worse. Several of his crew mates were still being removed from the ceiling of the cargo bay, strung up by their underwear, or what passed for that - in what was apparently called \"wedgies\" if he knew the lingo from the Sol sector. The ship itself was no better off. He didn't even want to know what the brownish stains all over the interior and some of the crew were, but it smelled awful.\n\n\"I'm saying that we had a malfunction in the surveillance system. A conductor plug broke and caused the cameras to go dark.\" Prekk repeated himself. \"There's no footage of what actually happened. So no - we cannot confirm your story.\" He continued before turning back to his assistant, a snort escaping his nose before he rubbed it. \"Oh dear, it seems I'm coming down with something - I better go and see the doctor, just in case.\" He looked over his shoulder at Captain Gremle, who's upper eye was currently twitching violently. \"Take care, Captain.\" He mused before trotting off with his staff.\n\n**30 minutes earlier...**\n\nMadam Besvakki walked around the front of the ugly ship, not even bothering to look around as she knew that the crew were huddled around the console, watching the Styssball game, oblivious to anything else. She gracefully waddled over to the hidden smugglers hatch that she knew Captain Gremle had installed near the forward landing gear and rustled the massive purse on her shoulder after she got the hatch open. From inside it, two bipeds climbed out and into the hidden compartment. She peeked in and gave a smile to the two humans, Mikaela and Simon who were currently looking back at her with expectant faces.\n\n\"I expect you back in 20 minutes\" She held up a small card with a particular shape, which seemed to click inside the Humans' heads, prompting a grunt and chirp in response.\n\n\"Until then...\" She loved this part. \"Go apeshit.\" Their faces suddenly twisted into mischievous grins at the command, an expression she returned before walking back to the hangar entrance, hearing the rapid scuttling noises vanish into the ship.\n\nSometimes business was a pleasure, she thought.\n\n**End.**",
