            "selftext": "It was a Friday night as you sat at home alone, rather bored and a bit depressed, once more, you were without a date, it really was annoying how little luck you had in the dating department, though you could understand why considering your interests.\n\nLike many, you were more interested in sex than romance, but even if that wasn\u2019t a deal breaker the sex you tended to go for was more on the kinky side, the kind not every girl was crazy about, so even if they were into a little romp, they had to be really naughty, not an easy combo to find.\n\nAs you thought about this, you received a message on your phones, looked like an ad, it read \u201care you single? Lonely? Horny? Having trouble finding the right kind of girl to really give you what you need, well try the new app Match made in Heaven, guaranteed to find exactly what you\u2019re looking for\u201d.\n\nThe ad came with a download link, you had never even thought about using one of these apps, but you had heard some good things about this app, so maybe it was worth a shot, not like you had anything better to do.\n\nAfter downloading the app, you found it was pretty straightforward, make a profile, see other girls profiles, and see who interests you, but as you saw these profiles you were pretty impressed.\n\nThe girls on things like this are usually pretty shy sounding, but these girls were not, they were very open about their interests, especially the sexual ones, some of the fantasies you were reading were seriously turning you on, you had to go deeper.\n\nYou decided to specify you search, changing the settings to find girls that are more on the submissive side, as you\u2019re a more dominant type, and also for women more on the mature side, since your primary fantasy girls for domination were always MILFs.\n\nThe moment you hit search, you hit the jackpot, so many gorgeous mature women, each with their own particular interests and desires, any one of them would be a wild night, and the more you read the more you wanted them, these profiles were spectacular.\n\n**Sunset Boulevardez**\n\nSexy Latina cop\n\nTotal foot freak and has a soft spot for bad girls\n\nFavorite fantasy: getting caught while on patrol by a naughty girl, or several, and used in all kinds of nasty ways, from being stripped and played with to be used as a foot stool for them while they mock and tease me.\n\n**Rita Loud**\n\nMother that loves to take all the love she can get\n\nAdores group play, everything from three ways to orgies, bring all your interests\n\nFavorite fantasy: simply too many to count.\n\n**Carol Kincaid**\n\nHard working former hero\n\nLoves hot sweaty action, the kind you really have to work for\n\nFavorite fantasy: getting into a contest with someone at the gym that ends with the both of us on the floor sweating like crazy, wanna have a real struggle before you manage to beat me, then I\u2019m all yours.\n\n**Ann Possible**\n\nIntelligent and sexy brain surgeon\n\nAdores peril and kidnapping scenarios\n\nFavorite fantasy: being abducted by some dirty villain and put in different types of dangerous yet thrilling situations, usually making use of different forms of bondage and sexual torture.\n\n**Alcina Dimitrescu**\n\nA proud but lonely lady\n\nLoves energetic partners, I\u2019m a big woman, I need someone that can satisfy my thirst\n\nFavorite fantasy: a group of lovely suitors comes to my door seeking aide, cold and afraid, naturally I offer them all the comforts of house Dimitrescu, so long as they are willing to give a lonely mother what she needs.\n\n**Mitsuki Bakugo**\n\nA gorgeous loudmouth\n\nBig fat orgasms, let me really see you explode all over me\n\nFavorite fantasy: I\u2019m laying in a bathtub while I\u2019ve got several partners around me, I\u2019m sucking, stroking, fucking, everything I can to get them off, and then they blow and cover me in hot thick cum, I want to literally bathe in cum.\n\n**Bulma**\n\nBig breasts with an even bigger brain\n\nLoves using toys and machines, most of which I make myself\n\nFavorite fantasy: it was a late night and I just finished my latest invention, a full body sex machine, one guaranteed to bring a woman to orgasm over and over without rest, but then, my own lab assistant betrayed me and stuck me into my own device, enjoying watching as I was stripped and my body subjected to every kind of pleasure possible until I\u2019m forced to cum uncontrollably.\n\n**Sindel**\n\nFormer empress now seeking to take a load off her mind\n\nLover of mind control and other forms of mental enslavement.\n\nFavorite fantasy: You are my most trusted ally, one who I tell everything to and I am 100 percent sure would never betray me, I was however wrong, before I knew it, you cast the same mind control spell that was used on me so long ago, turning me into your obedient slave ready to fulfill your every wish.\n\n**Vanilla**\n\nSweet and caring bunny mommy\n\nLoves to spoil her girls as much as possible\n\nFavorite fantasy: it\u2019s been a long day for you, let mommy take care of you, do you want a snack? Or to rest? You can sleep on mommy\u2019s breasts, her thighs, her ass, wherever you like, mommy can give you a massage, feed you, and take care if you all day.\n\n**Ragyo kiryuin**\n\nA bad girl that needs punishment\n\nAll manner of rough sex, slapping, spanking, whipping all encouraged\n\nFavorite fantasy: I\u2019ve gotten into some trouble with the law, it\u2019s finally time for me to face judgement for what I\u2019ve done, and that judgement will be from you, you\u2019ve been granted the right to decide the best way to make me pay for my crimes, how will you do it?\n\n**Kali Belladonna**\n\nA faunus looking to get in touch with her roots\n\nPet play, collar me and treat me like a good kitty\n\nFavorite fantasy: I want to be someone\u2019s housecat, I want the full treatment, total nudity, with the exceptions of collars and leashes which are a must, lots of milk \u201cwink\u201d plenty of snuggling, a nice scratch behind the ears, treats and praise when I\u2019m good, punishment when I\u2019m bad.\n\nWith all these profiles, it\u2019s no wonder this app was so popular, and any one of them looked like they were ready to go at a moments notice, so the only real questions is who are you gonna pick first?\n\nAs you can probably already tell, this is a roleplay that focuses on your character meeting a number of sexy kinky MILFs through a dating app, you meet, discuss interests and desires, and then indulge in whatever your kinky hearts desires, a simple premise, but with a bonus.\n\nSee all the MILFs in this are from some form of fiction, some I\u2019m sure most of you can recognize from their sheer popularity, and that isn\u2019t all, we can include plenty of others, my knowledge of fictional MILFs is massive, and I love to play them getting all kinky.\n\nThe way it works is pretty straightforward, every MILF has a profile on the app listing some basic information, you find one you\u2019re interested in, message her, meet, and well you can probably guess where it goes from there.\n\nI gave each of the MILFs favorite kinks and fantasies, but they\u2019re all generally kinky, so don\u2019t be afraid to get them to do more, because trust me, they are very easy to convince, could use this to form your very own MILF harem if you like.\n\nYour character is up to you, make them however you wish, but I do have some requirements, they have to be younger than 30, I love MILFs being dommed by younger girls so I would prefer someone younger, 21-24 would be best, also they cannot be male, only female and futa characters welcome, beyond that, just try to be creative and not just rely so heavily on penetration to get the job done.\n\nMy limits are mainly no snuff, vore, gore, abuse, really dark stuff or male characters and vanilla sex, my kinks include JOI, bondage, feet, sweat, smells, spit, footwear, domination, humiliation, outercourse, ahegoa, armpits, mind control, muscular women, muscle worship, curvy women, lactation, milking, anal, rough play, stripping, bdsm, cum play, watersports, lost bets, teasing, toys, incest, exhibitionism, ass play, race play, slutty wear, rules, humiliating tasks, cameras, and more, feel free to ask about others.\r  \n\r  \nSeeking female and futa partners only, dominant partners preferred, subs not wanted, please message through direct messages, do not use chat by any means, I'm serious about that, thank you.",

            "selftext": "Carbon dust. Coal dust. Charcoal dust. It was so incredibly simple to make \u2013 but firing a plasma shot through it seemed to unravel the gravitic braid that held the plasma payload of the shot contained, releasing the energy very quickly \u2013 but just slowly enough that it didn\u2019t\u2019 really work as an explosion either.\n\nSmoke bombs were easy solutions, but something that could continually pump out ultra-fine coal dust required developing an actual motor to drive a pump, something Fred had never gotten around to\u2026. But ok, he had three weeks? How difficult could it be.\n\n\u2026it turned out to take twenty minutes, at least after having consulted one of his college textbooks on introductory electrical engineering. Fred felt really silly that he hadn\u2019t looked into this earlier. Ish quickly took his incredibly crude prototype and turned it into something Fred barely recognized \u2013 but the torque it cranked out was incredible! With a working pump, Fred was also able to perfect a lot of other designs, allowing for a deadly new arsenal for the championship.\n\nLady Vris in turn also took a more active role in Fred\u2019s weapon and armor development \u2013 or at least tried. She had the technical and engineering skills of a moist napkin, but Fred found her useful to bounce ideas off of, since Ish had never been one for intellectual sparring. It also didn\u2019t hurt to have an assistant in the whiteroom for weapons testing \u2013 though Ish more than once had to dissolve the floor underneath her to whisk Lady Vris away to safety, when explosives went off a little more than expected, or when other deadly weapons \u2018spilled\u2019 in the wrong direction.\n\nBy the time the championship rolled around Fred and Lady Vris both agreed that his chances of winning were beyond doubt \u2013 something that was apparently reflected in the line-up of other contestants:\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean they didn\u2019t enter enough tournaments?\u201d Fred asked, not really seeing the connection.\n\nLady Vris had Ish bring up the list of trainers and their fighters or fighting creatures that were qualified for the imperial championship: \u201cYou don\u2019t recognize any of these, of course, but neither do I\u2026 they\u2019re pretty much all new-comers. The imperial championship is usually full of seasoned trainers, ones who\u2019ve won the championship with their fighters in previous seasons \u2013 but there\u2019s almost none of that here\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how can that be? I thought you said everyone wanted this, for the honor?\u201d\n\nClosing her eyes for a moment and resting her head against Fred\u2019s chest briefly, Lady Vris flicked her tail so that it propelled her up through the pillows in the bed nest: \u201cYou have to win a certain amount of tournaments to qualify \u2013 all the seasoned trainers, once word got out about you, they stopped signing up. Ish, show me the tarnaian spread\u201d\n\nFred had no clue what that spread was \u2013 But Ish displayed a complicated list in the shining one language. The only thing Fred somewhat recognized was the symbols next to each line: House crests: \u201cI\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a list of trainers?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a list of trainers and how active they\u2019ve been this season, and how much they\u2019ve won\u201d Lady Vris noted as she skimmed the list quickly.\n\nLetting out a brief burst of laughter, Fred seized Lady Vris around her waist and pulled her close: \u201cSo its amateur hour at the imperial championship \u2013 good for them. They\u2019ll get to say they participated, and then they can watch as I take the champion back to school\u201d\n\n\u201cBack to school?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the dear champion can learn from the best\u201d\n\nThe imperial championship was \u2013 just like so many of the other tournaments, wreathed thickly in tradition, protocol and enough pomp and circumstance to make even the most hardened social butterfly puke. That said, Fred found the view getting there really cool.\n\n\u201cThis is The Silver Throne, high seat of the imperial house\u201d Lady Vris declared, gesturing at the screen showing their approach to the massive space station after they had folded space into the system.\n\nIt was larger than anything Fred had seen so far, which was saying something. Massive domes, many of them containing what looked like greenery, or a few ones that were less dome and more sphere, containing water, as if they were encapsulated oceans. Of course, the most impressive sight was what the space station was orbiting: A planet, but it was all silverlight, gleaming with the reflection of the local star.\n\n\u201cThat is the Allstar \u2013 the heart of our great civilization\u201d Lady Vris said with a degree of reverence that Fred found\u2026 odd \u2013 it was like hearing a devout catholic trying to explain the pope. She even raised her head, doing a variation of the throat-baring bow towards the Allstar, which Fred found really strange, all the while she made some kind of arcane gesture in front of her chest.\n\nWhile the view was incredible, then Fred soon noticed a different thing: \u201cWe\u2019re moving kind of slowly aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course \u2013 nobody is allowed to approach the Silver Throne at speed. We\u2019ll arrive in about seven hours\u201d\n\nStroking Lady Vris along the soft snake-like scales on her back, tracing his fingers along their edges, Lady Vris began to almost purr. He knew she likes this, and indeed Lady Vris made the most exquisite of cute noises: \u201cAlright then Fred \u2013 I guess we can do that until we land\u201d\n\nSeveral sticky and intimate hours later, Ish announced that the docking sequence was complete and that refuelling was underway. Exactly what passed for fuel was a mystery to Fred, but then again he was busy making last minute tweaks to his business suit attire: It needed to display the yellow and blue star of house Xilas somehow\u2026 and Fred was experimenting with something that looked a bit like a large medal.\n\n\u201cLady Vris \u2013 do you think this will work?\u201d\n\nWith a judging look, her lips pursed and her eyes steeled on the latest mock-up of polished platinum with yellow and blue diamonds that Ish had produced based on Fred\u2019s design, Lady Vris humm\u2019d and haww\u2019d indecisively: \u201cWe should have worked on this sooner. This has to be perfect\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks perfect to me \u2013 and we were a little\u2026 distracted\u2026 earlier\u201d Fred noted, feeling quite pleased with his work.\n\nWith a huff Lady Vris threw her arms up: \u201cIt\u2019ll do then \u2013 Ish, dress me \u2013 but please Fred, be careful and do exactly as we rehearsed. If we upset any imperial courtier, we can be disqualified on the spot\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if we run into the idiot who ruined my lunch at Lord Loro\u2019s place?\u201d\n\nIt was hard to miss the smirk on Lady Vris, which was just a tad too toothy for Fred\u2019s liking: \u201cOh he knows that if he tries anything we\u2019ll have recordings of him trying to antagonize you\u201d\n\n\u201cPlus the suspicious fact that before you were poisoned he erased the command logs\u201d Fred added, getting a nod from Lady Vris.\n\nExiting their ship led out to a massive boulevard, flanked on both sides by thousands of small private booth-pods floating up in the air, each featuring between two to five shining ones looking at the parade of arriving trainers and fighters or fighting creatures.\n\nFred had already read up what he\u2019d be fighting \u2013 and he had no worries \u2013 but it was still impressive to see the line-up of aliens, many of the trainers flanked by servants and other shining ones, probably advisors or family. By that comparison then Fred and Lady Vris walking \u2018alone\u2019 looked kind of drab.\n\n\u2026except there was a sharp difference between how many eyes that were trained on Fred and Lady Vris, versus how many who were paying attention to everything else. It spread like a wave through the audience, with hundreds of arms pointing and many a strange alien telescope or small camera drone comming out. The small cloud of orbiting camera drones above Fred was a clear demonstration of the what fighter the audience showed the most interest.\n\nAt the end of the parade the trainers lined up with their fighters and creatures. It was a little weird, seeing the other fighters in the line-up looking very much like mud-covered cavemen clad in piss-cured hides. A few of the larger fighting creatures were decked out in what appeared to be feathered head-dresses, or other ornaments that had been strapped on to the things, a bit like how one might try to dress up an elephant.\n\nOnce the line-up was complete, a pod flew out from the building overhead. From the pod a large purple banner with a single silver star hung \u2013 and as if struck by magic the audience fell silent.\n\n\u201cHonoured trainers and guests of the lands rath. This season\u2019s fights have been one of new blood and impressive revelations. I hope that you will all enjoy this championship and the victory celebrations. I understand that the imperial champion has spent the last sixteen days in isolation, meditating and training for this season\u2019s hunt\u201d a booming female voice said, ringing out from hidden speakers all over the place.\n\nFred knew from what Lady Vris had prepped him on that this was the empress, the official protector of the fights. The emperor would likely first show up to watch the actual fights, not all the pre-fight pomp and circumstance, if he would show up at all.\n\n\u201cTrainers, to the staging areas! The finest landscapers and sculptors have prepared this season\u2019s championship arenas, so these battles will be both beautiful and thrilling. Begin!\u201d the empress commanded, the crowd erupting into a deafening cheer.\n\nThe procession of the trainers and their fighters and fighting creatures started to file away to platforms that flew them away to the staging area.\n\nAt the staging area it was business as usual, with force-field cages everywhere. Trainers, advisors and servants milling about, issuing last second instructions to their fighters, or making plans based on what they could eaves-drop from their competition. A lot of eyes and ears were aimed in Fred and Lady Vris\u2019 direction, but again that was nothing new at that point. This was almost exactly the same as at the last half a dozen other tournaments Fred had fought in, and won.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long before pairs of fighters or fighting creatures were transported to the fighting arenas and released from their cages. Fred\u2019s turn came quickly \u2013 his fight ended minutes later, the giant bug-monster he was up against utterly destroyed with a few choice hollow-point bullets featuring sodium cores to its central mass.\n\nThe rest of the fights proceeded similarly easily for Fred. It was almost fun \u2013 almost, except Fred knew what was coming.\n\nIt took three days, but Fred won the finale of the championship with ease \u2013 the fighter he was up against trying to rush him with a well-made but hopelessly outclassed stone-tipped spear. Sure, Fred had seen the very same fighter in her fight against another giant alien bug creature, so Fred knew that this poor soul knew how to fight and how to take down creatures many times her own size. Still, she had brought a stone spear to a gunfight, so that was that, alien went splat.\n\nAfter the finale there was a grand ceremony, with all of the other participating trainers doing that throat-baring bow to Lady Vris. Fred found it dreadfully boring, but that was because he knew what was coming\u2026 the real fight \u2013 the fight that actually mattered \u2013 the fight that would win him back his freedom, or actually see him dead, reinforced skull or not.\n\nIt was the next day that the champion\u2019s hunt was scheduled.\n\nIt started almost like one of the many tournament fights Fred had participated in: Lady Vris and Fred showed up at the event to great fanfare, Lady Vris guiding Fred to a special platform that floated up in the air for all to see.\n\nRoughly ten-fifteen meters up in the air Fred was \u2018greeted\u2019 by the same stranger he had briefly met after the champion fight at House Xilas: A shining one female clad in a rich purple dress, decorated with the usual gaudy shining one jewellery, as well as several dozen small camera drones that seemed quite curious at him, all appearing like small flying orbs similar to what Lady Vris used in the arenas.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re the imperial champion\u201d Fred mused, not terribly impressed. Sure, the imperial champion appeared stronger and with more well-defined muscles than the likes of Lady Vris and her peers \u2013 she was also a bit taller than Lady Vris \u2013 but Fred knew quite well how easily shining ones broke after the fight with the house Xilas champion.\n\nThe imperial champion on her floating platform orbited Fred, observing him in his business suit quite carefully: \u201cAnd you are the house Xilas war-smith. I do hope you aren\u2019t planning on fighting in that outfit\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not \u2013 this is just formal attire\u201d Fred noted, finding the imperial champion\u2019s annoyed tone somewhat telling. Had she been expecting to check out Fred\u2019s weapons before the fight? Was she annoyed that he wasn\u2019t showing off his arsenal in advance? It was hard to tell.\n\nDown on the ground Lady Vris seemed to be swarmed by well-wishers and others congratulating her on the great honor that it obviously was to be the trainer who supplied the quarry for the hunt \u2013 she didn\u2019t look like she needed any help with any of that.\n\n\u201cHey, look up here \u2013 your trainer can\u2019t help you now\u201d the imperial champion said, sounding annoyed that she didn\u2019t have Fred\u2019s undivided attention.\n\nWith a bit of laughter Fred turned his gaze back up to the champion: \u201cWhat? You afraid I\u2019m going to turn the hunt on you? Also, I never got your name\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need my name \u2013 just as I don\u2019t need yours. Ish will put your name on the trophy plaque just fine\u201d the imperial champion said with a haughty snort, coming off as no small amounts of offended that Fred wasn\u2019t at the very least showing respect.\n\nNodding, Fred found himself agreeing: \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right: When Ish stuffs and mounts you, I\u2019ll have it do you up in a silly pose, to mock you and the very memory of these hunts\u201d\n\nWith a deep sigh the champion rubbed the brow of her snout and had her platform bring her up close to Fred: \u201cI have observed many recordings of you, even ones from social functions. I understand that you are not quite as savage as the usual mud-throwers I come up against \u2013 but your barbarism shows none the less. Make no mistake: You are the one to be hunted\u201d\n\nFred kept looking straight ahead, the camera drones ever so curious about him \u2013 but he knew from Lady Vris that they were only there for visual feeds, not audio, to which end he quietly stated: \u201cI have developed ways of neutralizing the plasma blasts from your Tiberon rifle. You will not be able to hurt me \u2013 so I am not making any mistakes here: You\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to be hunted, I hope you can run well\u201d\n\nThe champion floated away from Fred ever so slightly, her looking quite apprehensive: \u201cYou\u2026 Ish, check his records \u2013 has the rules on technology exposure been upheld?\u201d\n\nThe voice of the local Ish was\u2026 different \u2013 it made a few clicks before its voice came on, as if things were switching on. It wasn\u2019t robotic, it was fluid and organic in its pronunciation, plus it had inflections hinting of an odd accent: \u201cThis fighter has not been informed of the true nature of silverlight or derived technologies Mistress K\u2019Vir\u201d\n\nOk, so now the champion had a name \u2013 and they had a weird Ish here, maybe an older model? Or just one that had run for longer and aged into better speech patterns?\n\nLady K\u2019Vir certainly didn\u2019t look happy to hear that Fred was cleared for the hunt, given his stated threat towards her: \u201cA pathetic attempt at deception \u2013 trying to make me worried that you might actually harm me? I\u2019ve seen the recordings; I know how you fight. You won\u2019t be able to get near me\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you are bringing that slow-down field you usually use against fighters. Great, that actually works to my advantage\u201d Fred noted with a smile.\n\nThis was off-script. Lady K\u2019Vir had been the imperial champion for quite some time \u2013 had shot and killed more fighters and fighting creatures than she cared to remember \u2013 even other war-smiths, but this guy? This barbarian, he spoke with a fearless certainty and candour that her splendour and station seemingly could not assail \u2013 or put differently, then her quarry, despite knowing what was about to happen, was not fearing for his life\u2026 and where was the fun in that?\n\nFred watched Lady K\u2019Vir as she seemed confused, angered and frightened all at once: \u201cIt will hurt, a lot. The weapons I\u2019ve brought won\u2019t kill you quickly\u2026 that\u2019s not possible with your shield, but that might also mean you\u2019ll have a shot at forfeiting before you die\u201d\n\nHer face contorting into an angry sneer, her fangs almost bared \u2013 but not enough to cause a scene, for there were quite a lot of people watching \u2013 Lady K\u2019Vir floated away from Fred: \u201cI am done here. Bring my quarry to the preserve\u201d\n\nLady Vris had told Fred of this: The hunt always took place in the Imperial Preserve. It was housed in one of the domes that were part of the grand palatial space station, by no means the largest, but it was still absolutely huge\u2026 but Fred also knew from a lot of the recordings of previous hunts, that the imperial champion and its prey were usually set up fairly close to each other, but just out of view of each other.\n\nThe transit was surprisingly quick, and Fred had barely even noticed that he had been equipped \u2013 to his relief it was his special custom loadout for the hunt.\n\nElsewhere in the preserve the imperial champion appeared, clad in a glorious uniform wrought of beautiful white, purple and silver materials. Human fashionistas might have mistaken the outfit for a somewhat style-confused safari outfit \u2013 which honestly wasn\u2019t that far off \u2013 but that was also where the similarities ended, as the imperial champion\u2019s single piece of equipment looked very much otherworldly: The Tiberon rifle was an absolute technological marvel of micro-fusion, plasma-generation and gravitic braiding, looking both delicate and powerful, its cleft barrel revealing the gravitic actuators visible inside spooling up and glowing a baleful blue not unlike the Cherenkov radiation one might see if looking into an active nuclear reactor.\n\nWith a gallant stride that all onlookers would identify as a confident gait informed by all manners of superiority, the imperial champion began search for her prey. It covered Lady K\u2019Vir\u2019s nervousness perfectly, and her hat and visor obscured her eyes enough that none of the camera drones following her could see how she was desperately scanning the grasslands for her quarry\u2026 no, her opponent.\n\nNormally walking the imperial preserve was a privilege that only those favoured by the imperial court got to experience \u2013 a fragment from the lost ages, from when the shining ones had a homeworld. The air was different than the usual ship or station fare, and there were sounds that were said to stir the soul. To Fred it was just another arena with an alien biome: the grass was green, but still a little off-coloured, and the bugs crawling around in the bushes didn\u2019t look like anything he knew from Earth.\n\nOh well, time to pollute a little: Flicking a series of switches on his left arm, Fred tripped the relays that started the electrical engines in his armored backpack. The multiple exhaust pipes shuddered and began to billow thick clouds of black smoke. It was the finest of carbon dust, a continually generating smoke-screen that would dissolve the plasma blasts that were sure to come his way, drawing from a storage vessel that held enough dust to let Fred generate a smokescreen for well over an hour at full blast, or almost a dozen hours if he dialled the motors down.\n\nThe imperial champion quickly spotted the black cloud beyond the ridge to her left. It also confused her greatly, because of all the multitudes of strange alien beasts she had fought, then none had ever smoked\u2026\n\nFred knew that he\u2019d likely be spotted long before he\u2019d see the champion \u2013 but from the recordings of previous hunts, then he knew that the champions didn\u2019t really ever try to hide, so once the champ started to shoot at him, then it should be easy enough to spot his target.\n\nOnce he got up on the ridge those shots started coming in quite rapidly.\n\nBetween the augmented reality visor built into the champion\u2019s hat, and the usual blast radius of the shots fired from the tiberon rifle, then Lady K\u2019Vir didn\u2019t really expect much of a challenge \u2013 well, normally \u2013 but she had reviewed Fred\u2019s progress in the fights and how he had constantly developed new weapons\u2026 at least until he had developed functioning firearms, at which point he had stopped bringing new weapons to bear at the fights. This had made her highly suspicious of what he might have come up with for the hunt. Was this smoke thing part of that? Was it some kind of scheme to poison her?\n\nIf only the imperial champion had known how close to the truth she was \u2013 yet, she was still not entirely correct.\n\nOh well \u2013 line up the shot, strike a dazzling pose, pull the trigger. The champion\u2019s tiberon rifle responded instantly, drawing a tiny amount of superheated plasma and wrapping it tightly in a gravitic braid, then pulling that knot of gravity out along the length of the barrel at super-sonic speeds. The gravitics in the barrel made the weapon self-stabilizing, meaning there was no real recoil to speak of \u2013 this made it easier to assume fancy poses for the adoring crowd, even if that was probably the last thing on the mind of the weapon\u2019s original designers back when the Shining Ones actually knew how silverlight worked.\n\nSure, the \u2018cheering crowd\u2019 was distributed throughout the palatial station, watching via camera drones, but the moment the plasma blast struck the black smoke surrounding Fred it instantly exploded\u2026 but not in the usual way. It just evaporated into a large puff! Sure, it was a really hot puff of gas, hot enough to instantly char the grass near it, but the heat simply dissipated so quickly that nothing really managed to catch fire.\n\nFred had of course had plenty of time to work up countermeasures to this. His suit of armor was \u2018only\u2019 strong enough to protect him if a stray shot hit the ground, or a tree, or a rock near him that showered him with bits of wood or stone shards, but it also contained a very nice cooling system \u2013 because the heat was more than enough to cook him if not cooled pretty quickly.\n\nThe champion and the countless shining ones of course cared nothing for such technical details, be it how the tiberon rifle worked or how Fred\u2019s kit worked \u2013 they were a lot more focus on and confused about why Fred hadn\u2019t exploded in a hot shower of meat vapours.\n\nIn a fine display of discipline, Lady K\u2019Vir lined up and fired two quick shots into the smoke cloud. It was pretty obvious that the puffs blew away part of the smoke when the plasma shots disintegrated, but it just came back too fast for her to get shots to actually hit Fred. Sure, Fred\u2019s cooling system was stressed to a little beyond maximum capacity, Fred very quickly beginning to sweat like a pig in his armor \u2013 but after those three shots the champion seemed to realize that just shooting at Fred wouldn\u2019t work, giving Fred precious time to cool down again, vent overheated coolant but also to peer through the smoke and actually spot the champion.\n\nRaising his almost comically oversized weapon at the champion, while more or less completely obscured by the smoke around him, Fred pulled the trigger once. There was a noticeable thud as the grenade left the barrel, followed by a click as he rotated the drum magazine into position for the next shot.\n\nThe oversized grenade sailed through the air fast, but not much faster than an arrow, in the general direction of the champion\u2026 but it didn\u2019t land anywhere near her. As it hit the ground it bounced ever so slightly in the grass a little, then burst into a shower of fire and flame, the incendiary round lighting off.\n\nThe champion let out a laugh, knowing that there were loads of camera drones observing her and listening in, awaiting her biting remarks: \u201cPathetic\u2026 can you even see where you\u2019re aiming?\u201d\n\nFred couldn\u2019t hear the champion \u2013 but he could see the bright light from the fire, giving him a rough idea of where he had hit. Alright, time to take a risk: turning a dial, Fred reduced his smoke-screen output to one tenth for a moment, and darted out of the smoke cloud to get a proper look. Knowing to look in the direction of the fire, Fred quickly spotted the extravagantly dressed champion.\n\nClad not just in imperial haute couture, but imperial hunting couture, Lady K\u2019Vir was quite surprised to see Fred pop out of the smoke. He looked strange, clearly not clad in the same kind of gear that he usually fought in\u2026 his helmet seemed to have far less detail, and his armor looked less bulky \u2013 and it had tubes sticking out of it.\n\nOf course, what worried the champion the most was the massive gun Fred had levelled at her \u2013 she holding her rifle in a relaxed fashion with just one hand by her side. When Fred pulled the trigger, a second grenade the size of a generic can of food, tumbled through the air. The champion had to laugh: Was he really going to try to light her on fire?\n\nIt made sense \u2013 she had seen him use grenades that sprayed burning liquid before. Against fighting characters with fur it had worked quite well, but against an imperial champion? Really? Lady K\u2019Vir simply had to laugh.\n\nA testament to the amount of time Fred had spent target practicing with his new grenade launcher, the grenade flew in a wide arc and would have hit the champion somewhere around the left shoulder if not caught in the shield bubble around her almost two meters away from her. As far as the champion was concerned, it was a sad and futile display.\n\nNow, Fred had seen plenty of recordings of previous champions up against fighters, so he had a pretty good idea of how the champion\u2019s shield worked. He suspected that it was some kind of automated system that would catch any kind of projectiles that got near the champ, and drop it safely to the ground, using the same kind of gravity technology that the ships used.\n\nLady K\u2019Vir looked at the metal canister with disdain \u2013 if the thing was about to explode her shield would catch it, and if it was about to turn into fire like the other one, then it would only spray fire in a small area around itself. Again, pathetic \u2013 but a good try.\n\nThe top and bottom of the canister popped off, and then\u2026 black smoke billowed out.\n\nOf all the things that Lady K\u2019Vir could feel, then she felt insulted: \u201cAt least try to actually kill you idiot!\u201d\n\nFred could only faintly hear what was being shouted, but he didn\u2019t care he just needed to wait a few seconds. The champion was kicking at the smoke, looking quite unsatisfied with Fred\u2019s ploy \u2013 plus the black smoke seemed to be sticking to her feet. Disgusting!\n\nWhile distracted, Fred advanced on the champion, shielded just barely by his smoke screen. The periscope he had made to peer our from the smoke cloud was shaky as hell, and the lens and mirrors were getting covered in soot. He needed to get closer, because the next couple of grenades he wanted to fire were heavier - they wouldn\u2019t fly as far.\n\nStepping well away from the smoke grenade, Lady K\u2019Vir noticed that Fred was approaching. Two pot-shots at his smoke-screen only resulted in more pulses of very hot gas bursting forth and scorching the ground between Fred and the champion, but it also stopped his advance \u2013 good. At this point she really didn\u2019t want him getting anywhere near her \u2013 she had seen recordings of his sword-play, or that exploding spear of his.\n\nStanding roughly a hundred and sixty or so meters from the champion, at a slightly elevated position halfway down the ridge, Fred took careful aim. This one had to hit, or it would give his game away\u2026 and his backup plans were very limited.\n\nThe dull thud from the grenade launcher was barely audible to Lady K\u2019Vir, but her visor picked up the incoming canister. Another? Really? Was he going to try to annoy her to death? It certainly would be a novel strategy\u2026 but really?\n\nThe canister flew in a much lower arc, dropping faster \u2013 but Fred was much closer. Tumbling through the air, the canister was caught by the shield just above the ground to the champion\u2019s left. This time it didn\u2019t spray out fire or black smoke \u2013 but pale yellow smoke\u2026\n\n\u201cSuch a dasling display of color \u2013 is thi-\u201d the champion began, but her words stopped as her lungs and throat began to burn.\n\nFred had observed in the recordings of former champion hunts that some champions had complained or quipped about the stench of some of their quarries \u2013 so gas and vapors seemed to pass through the shield just fine\u2026 which meant that chlorine gas would also pass through it. Producing the stuff had been easy enough: Fred had known how to make the stuff for ages, ever since that mod-pack he liked for Minecraft had begun to include chemical ore extraction and processing.\n\nFrom his periscope Fred saw the champion try to run away from the gas \u2013 but the canister was stuck in her shield, and Fred had seen in the old recordings that arrow and thrown spears would remain in the shield until swatted away. In her panic it seemed that the champion hadn\u2019t really thought of that \u2013 though Fred figured it was more likely that she simply wasn\u2019t used to having to clear her shield of debris.\n\nAdvancing with the champion sprinting around in circles trying to out-run the chlorine gas billowing out to her left down at the ground, Fred tapped his helmet to check the seals on his gas mask. Aside from the air-filtration to make sure he wouldn\u2019t inhale all the smoke he was pumping out, then he\u2019d also had to reverse engineer a functional gas-mask\u2026 and holy shit that had not been fun to test, especially not when the first four prototypes hadn\u2019t worked during tests with his own chlorine gas.\n\nRunning at the champion, Fred came at her like a pain train wreathed in darkness. While distracted, the champion did see him coming \u2013 darting out of the way quite artfully, though her dodge was severely complicated by the gas canister billowing yellow chlorine gas out at her.\n\nMissing her, Fred swung around only to see the champion having brought up and levelled her rifle at his chest, looking and sounding quite angry: \u201cThis farce ends now!\u201d\n\nFred wasn\u2019t sure how well her aim really was, considering the smoke he was still emanating, but as the champion was about to pull the trigger she started to cough \u2013 bleeding from her nose and coughing up blood.\n\nOne of Fred\u2019s contingency plans had been a set of gas grenades hidden around on him. A button on his gauntlets would trigger them \u2013 but he didn\u2019t want to displace what little carbon-smoke he had between him and the champ.\n\nLooking quite pissed that her one-liner and execution combo had been disrupted, Lady K\u2019Vir wiped her mouth and nose and finally pulled the trigger.\n\nTo all the camera drones hovering around the two, all they saw was a flash of light as the tiberon rifle did two things, pretty much at the same time: As usual when pulling the trigger on the device, it fired a shot of plasma in a gravity braid \u2013 but the carbon dust particles in the air caught the bubble almost before it managed to leave the barrel, resulting in contact between the blindingly hot plasma and the barrel aperture. Sure, a lot of the plasma managed to vent out and disperse as another searing hot puff of gas, but the barrel exploded just the same.\n\nThe second thing that happened was that plasma core of the rifle cycled in fresh air to compress and heat up into plasma \u2013 but there was carbon dust in that too\u2026 and the internal containment failed because of that for the same reason as the plasma round. This made the whole gun blow up.\n\nThe time between these two things happening were down to a level where telling them apart normally wouldn\u2019t really matter, but the forces at play made up for that: The core technically exploded first, threatening to shower both Fred and the champion with a hot burst of white-hot shrapnel \u2013 but the barrel explosion turned away most of the shards heading Fred\u2019s way as the two blast fronts met.\n\nAs far as Fred was concerned he just felt the force of what seemed to be a single explosion, and he felt dozens of small things pinging off his armor at very speeds \u2013 his visor even cracked in four spots on the outer layer, but the champion got a far rougher treatment: the hail of white-hot shrapnel shredded her arms, much of her face and a good deal of her left leg, plus knocking her over backwards, putting the gas-canister down next to her face, and her largely unable to shuffle away from it.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m (25F) living at home with the folks right now. My plans for leaving home got uprooted this year when my partner and I broke up so my family has been more then supportive in letting me live at home with them while i focus on building my career. They will not let me pay rent but I help out as much as I can around the house, I clean, I offer to pay for groceries but they always refuse. My parents are well off financially and it\u2019s almost seen as an insult I want to give them money. I do my own grocery shopping every 2 weeks just for me- but my 21 year old sister ends up eating the food too because we have none in the house. My dad will join in too because there\u2019s nothing else. But when I try to bring this up they say they spend way too much on groceries already there\u2019s no way we don\u2019t have enough. But I\u2019m telling you. It\u2019s eggs, milk, bread and yogurt, and the odd veggie. That\u2019s it. How do 4 of us make meals off this?? My mom eats eggs, toast, cereal and yoghurt for all her meals so she\u2019s always fed. If I ate the food she bought she wouldn\u2019t have any. But then the comments start when I bring out the things I have paid for. I put them all in a separate mini fridge that gets raided. \nThey mock me if something goes bad before I eat it. They say my food choices aren\u2019t healthy but look at them.  I\u2019m feeding my father and my sister and it\u2019s really starting to piss me off. It\u2019s one thing not to feed me, I\u2019m 25 it\u2019s more then okay- but don\u2019t insert yourself into my choices then. \n\nAnd She will say \u201c just ask for something then and we will get it\u201d so we do- and she comes back without it. Every time. I feel like I\u2019m losing it .",

            "selftext": "Hi guys, my native language is Russian and I'm going to tell you my story about how I began to learn English and how I managed to reach this level in 10 months. Unbeliveable, but in January I almost didn't know anything and couldn't understand anything! \n\n**December 2020** First off, I started learning it with Duolingo (exactly as 99% people do while learning a new language), however, it turned out to be helpless for me, I used it for a month but I didn't notice any progress. Then I downloaded another app - Cake, it goes without saying that it's a great app, I did learn some words... and that's it, I had no idea about how I should have learned a language and therefore I had no progress\n\n**Januaray 2021** I was desperately going over various forums in order to find apps to learn English, nevertheless I came across one recommendation with the link to one youtube channel where a guy teaches people English grammar. If you're interested what channel it is, here's the link - [https://www.youtube.com/c/%D0%90%D0%9D%D0%93%D0%9B%D0%98%D0%99%D0%A1%D0%9A%D0%98%D0%99%D0%AF%D0%97%D0%AB%D0%9A%D0%9F%D0%9E%D0%9F%D0%9B%D0%95%D0%99%D0%9B%D0%98%D0%A1%D0%A2%D0%90%D0%9C](https://www.youtube.com/c/%D0%90%D0%9D%D0%93%D0%9B%D0%98%D0%99%D0%A1%D0%9A%D0%98%D0%99%D0%AF%D0%97%D0%AB%D0%9A%D0%9F%D0%9E%D0%9F%D0%9B%D0%95%D0%99%D0%9B%D0%98%D0%A1%D0%A2%D0%90%D0%9C))\n\nI was immensely interested in it, since I observed lots of positive reviews about him and I just wanted to try it out.\n\nWell, he had lots of playlists but I chose the largest one (1032 videos) , and his method was pretty interested, 20% is theory, and the other 80% is just PRACTICE such as translating from Russian into English, lots of practice. One control work consisted of 7000 sentences (200 videos).\n\n**February 2021** I sucessfully was watching this playlist and was invogorated seeing my progress! I could understand simple sentences. I also downloaded an application to memorize words in order to ease my learning, and no, I didn't choose Quizlet or Anki, it was Reword. The best app for learning new words, unfortunately it's not free but if you want you can always bypass it if you have an Android.\n\n**March 2021** At this point my level was something between A1-A2, I could read Reddit and understand approximately 20-25% and the same percentage with Youtube (with subtitles). I could comment videos, posts in English, not gonna lie that it's likely that these comments contained grammatical mistakes.\n\n**April 2021** I still was watching that course, I would spend 2-3 hours per day on it, in April I already had a strong A2 level, I could understand 30-40% watching a video (without subtitles) if a native speaker spoke distinctly and didn't use complex words\n\n**May 2021** It dawned on me that I can, I already can talk to people, to native speakers, I downloaded one app - HelloTalk, and texted some people, most of them were surprised that I had been learning English only for 4-5 months, and I didn't make a lot of mistakes, however, I still didn't know what Conditionals is and other important grammatical stuff hence I could make some mistakes.\n\n**June 2021** Finished course, completely, my final score was 97%, I challenged myself and passed IELTS (mock) academic test (ngl it was hard) and scored 5, according to CEFR it was a B1 level. I got a B1 level in less than 6 months and was over the moon. At this point I knew 90% of English grammar and I had to fix things such as listening and speaking. I started watching English news, movies, podcasts. I cannot describe how happy I was when I watched the whole series in English understanding 80-90% of words (with subtitles), I also got down to learning American Phonetic Alphabet, I used one channel for it, if you're interested which channel, here's the link - [https://www.youtube.com/c/SoundsAmerican](https://www.youtube.com/c/SoundsAmerican)\n\nI don't think I should describe the ensuing months after it since I got this well-known \"Intermediate Plateau\" and there was nothing interesting, I was just learning new words, watching movies/news, enhancing my accent and speaking. I also could speak with a native speaker in real time through Discord, I spoke slowly but I could, and we could perfectly understand each other.\n\n**October 2021** Passed that IELTS Academic (mock) Exam (not real one, but going to take it soon) and got a 6.5 score, that according to CERF signifies a B2 level. I reached it absolutely for free, I spent nothing on it although I heard that it was unfeasible to reach this level for free.\n\nI've written all of this without using a translatior, so please, if you notice any mistakes, tell me.\n\n And yeah, I forgot to mention one thing, I had motivation - study in Canada. I wish you good luck in learning languages!",

            "selftext": "Hey, this happened a long time ago, but I just want to talk about it. So, when i was 16, I got really angry at my mom and hit her several times and my sis called the cops. My mom has some mental health issues and she isnt a nice person to me, my sis, or my dad. Before this,  I tried to have a respectful conversation with her and explain how her actions and words make me feel. She dismissed me every single time and would mock me, say everyone was against her, and that my dad put me up to this (I was 16, and I would have these convos with her on my own volition). Anyway, the police show up and she said my mom told the cop my clothes were innapropriate (they were not. I was wearing Jean's and a blouse that covered everything. I later showed the outfit to my dad and councilor who didnt see anything wrong with it). Anyway I interrupted my mom and said that my clothes were not club clothes and the cop screamed at me to shut up. My sis looked at her confused because she wasn't sure why she was screaming. Anyway, I told the cop what happened and then also explained that I was having issues with my mom and my own mental health and the cop shouted that I was entitled and that \"I think I know everything\" and went into a long rant about \"kids these days\". She also complained about her own 16 year old son and said that before me, she just responded to a call about another teenage boy going crazy.  I know that I'm the asshole for hitting my mom and that I could have reacted better. However, I hate how a random person can spend 5 minutes in someone else's house and make a rediculous judgement like that. I have had a job since I was 16 ( I started job searching at 14 but not many places hire 14 yearold lol) and my dad pays for some of my college and I pays for some of it. I pay for gas and and groceries and I have never had any interest of mooching off my parents for the rest of my life. I was always well behaved in school and never through tantrums( I probably would have gotten a spanking). Also, the cop said that I probably just needed a spanking on my bare bottom (again, my dad spanked me with a belt all the way up until I was 14. Not often, but I got them). Anyway, I guess I'm mad because I felt invalidated and I posted this asking if I was justified at being mad at the cop.",
