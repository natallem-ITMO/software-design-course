It has happened so many times to the point where I can not even be angry anymore is exhausting really. \n\n\nFor the people that are defending her are u guys okay? Stop envalitadting black peopels feelings if we want an apology then non black people shouldn't call us sensitive or unresneble. \n\nThe N -word has been used against black people to mock them for their skin colour and degrade them. The n-word has been reclaimed buy black people and over time we use it amongst ourselves ( like we don't say it with the hard R.) And not every black person use it it can be bc they feel uncomfortable with it or know the history behind it and just don't wanna use it so what makes u think its right for non black people to use it? \n\nGiselle is a grown woman that can speak English she also went to a international school and she is also a rapper. I highly doubt that she dosent know what the n -word means or that non black people should use it. Is 2021 we don't need this to happen again.",

            "selftext": " Since I can remember myself, I remember lack of love and interest by my family, verbal and emotional abuse by teachers and fellow students at school. As I grew up, girls would mock me or play with my feelings. School is tough ( EU schools) and I'd focus most of my day in studying and playing video games in order to have something to help me since girls are rejecting me and I find no family comfort and love.\n\n At 14y.o, at a school trip a fellow female classmate(same age) sexually assaults me at the hotel we stayed for the trip. Never told anyone or came out publicly, and thats how my first experience with women started.  Same story continues to university where I live basically like a monk, studying and being alone with my thoughts the rest of the time ,apart from working out being my only joy. All the while,school classmates and university classmates have ''normal'' lives, having friends, being in relationships, living a healthy lifestyle. On the contrary, I get heartbreak after heartbreak with nobody to talk to, wether that may be friendships or girls. My neighbours made my life miserable, by smashing their porches doors at 1 in the morning, doing laundry at 3 am, having their dogs shit in front of my house. When I confronted them, they simply played dumb and ignored me. At the same time, university professors dont care about their job and instead try to play God and not only do not teach us properly, they also tried to make us fail on their classes to show how important/difficult their classes are. \n\nI get one girlfriend at 18y.o, she was the same age as me(18), shortly after I get to do my practice at my military university and go on a tour for 6 months. After I return, she starts slowly distancing herself until she leaves and a few months later, I confront her and she simply says he just couldnt keep this up cause she got accepted in a uni at another town. I felt a lot of things for this person, so it hurt me for 3 years. \n\nA few months ago, I had some interests and talks with some girls of my age ( early 20s) but they would still use/ or ghost me.I decided to give a chance to another person who projected herself as a good person for a 2nd relationship, but she ended up manipulating, gaslighting and flirting(possibly cheating as well) with a friend of hers. When I connected the dots, I ended things. I tried talking with some girls as well, things ended up as well where they always do, lies, gaslighting and when they arent interested anymore, just gone. \n\n Now, I have graduated university, I have been scammed by a lawyer I hired to do some official paperwork, I am in the process of making up for that lost time because of the lawyer, I have army obligatory service(in my country its obligatory) coming up, and I have to find a job afterwards. I have noone to talk to, no family member I can get love from, no friend who will be there for me, no good girlfriend who will love me and appreciate me back and create meaningful bond. \n\n Am I wrong being this tired with people? Ive been always hearing that there are some good people out there, that I have to keep looking, that there are always good friends, girlfriends out there, but I dont see anything. I am tired and exchausted of trying to make friends, family members, women of my age etc, to find people to actually care about me mutually , each on their own category. Im so done with people. I cant do it anymore. I have to prioritize myself and not look back for anyone else. I know it sounds egotistical, but before, I was alone and trying to find company of others, now I dont want it and I will be alone at least. I do not ask for anyone feeling bad for me and dont want it. I just want hope that not everything and everyone is how I described it above. Just this. But I have lost my faith. I feel like a wounded animal that doesnt trust people because previous owners or people have harmed it. I cant trust other people and I dont know what to do anymore. \n\n Thank you to anyone who read my life story.",
