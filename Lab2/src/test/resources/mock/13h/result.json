            "selftext": " **CW for trauma, suicide talk, and mental illness stuff.**\n\nI don't wanna dump all my trauma history here, it's very specific and personal, but long story short, I got abused by (identical twin) at different levels throughout my life, becoming worse at late childhood/early teens. He's way better now, apologized, etc. but I'm scarred.\n\nA bit more detail: he had unfounded paranoia about me being the favored twin and took it out on me, even if it rarely got physical, would emotionally manipulate, lash out/mock attempts at individuality, threaten to take away things (normal things like internet accounts or, yknow, an entire ear) and be codependent. I would always be at least lowkey scared and was the kind who would cover up + make excuses for my abuser, even to the numerous psychologists (which we always shared, which was a bad idea). Parents were full of their own issues, older sister was not a great or compatible human being, and we were constantly changing schools, so me, an autistic kid with no individuality, had no chance at individual friendships so my abusive twin was all I had for years and years. He'd switch from threatening to hurt himself and threaten me and my things on a heartbeat. So I'd withstand the abuse and blame myself because I didn't want him trying to kill himself. Meanwhile, he cared for me more than anything, which just made my feelings confused. And there's a lot other specifics and details that just make it more fucked up and impossible for anyone to understand.\n\nAfter years of abuse and fragile crawling bits of individuality and dissociation/unstable sense of self, the \"actual\" me took over the body more, over whatever other facets/alters were there. I don't refer to the body's past as me, but I did it here for the sake of making things more readable for people. I was tired of the abuser's bullshit, I did not care how bad his mental health got, with my paranoia there were days I would ready myself for the possibility of coming back to him with a knife behind the door ready to kill me or to his body in the shower or something (neither ever happened). Since I wasn't whoever was in control of the body before, I actually had my own identity, even though I kept some of the preferences that were there before.\n\nI do recognize that now, years into our adulthoods, he's no longer a threat and is genuinely sorry and whatnot. I'm like, whatever. I still do the bare family minimum since we still have to live together. But I don't like him, I don't wanna be his \"friend\", and even hearing the word \"twin\" or having to legally check the box that I have one in documents for fraud prevention irks me. I still wish either me or him or both hadn't been born.\n\nThere are many reasons I feel dysphoric and dysmorphic in my body, and one of them is definitely that I look and sound like him. I hate looking in the mirror, or opening my mouth, and just seeing/hearing my ex-abuser. I want to do some pretty extensive body modifications to look less and less like him, though sadly I think voice surgeries are only possible for making your voice higher pitched, and I absolutely don't want it like that, I've had enough people mistaking me for a girl as is. And I don't know how to deal with this. My nightmares and dreams still act like it's 15 years ago and everyone in the family looks that much younger in them, I fear that even if I no-contact my twin for years I'll never be able to not hear him when I talk. I wish I could forget him. This is not something that non-identical-twins really have to ever think about. Even after the abuse has ended and he's no longer a bad person, I'm still haunted and irked by being in this cursedly \"clone\" body. Currently I'm looking forward to maybe something like those electronic voice changers, and I've been told about voice therapy, but I don't know how much voice therapy could help...\n\nalso: if your only response would be \"find a psychologist\", maybe don't? I already have a psychiatrist, she doesn't get it, that's why I'm here, for input from folks who have actually experienced being identical/near identical twins. Bonus for anyone else who is also ASD, ADHD, C-PTSD...",
