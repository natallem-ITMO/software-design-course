Anyhow, my question is I am gonna graduate in August 2022 should I appeal the case and tell I will need to start applying to jobs in my last year ( January 2022) in hopes of landing a full-time job? That time also includes Resume writing, mock interviews and skills development. Job searches take anywhere from 3-6 months to land a full-time job (including time to prepare). The manager on the phone told me that I could appear but I have to be ready and available to work (despite what I told her). Finally, I call EI again and the agent said yes, I could do that what I just said. \n\nLet me know what you guys think.",

But I speak for many when I say the user friendliness is not as modern or current as let\u2019s say Robinhood or webull. Personally I love what fidelity has done with the upgrades but I have to admit when I\u2019m looking to place some option trades, I\u2019ll usually look up the charts on webull and then run a mock trade on Robinhood to make sure I have it correct. Then place the trade on fidelity. It\u2019s also much easier to find the Greeks elsewhere. Im just sayin. These changes would be amazing. I\u2019m here for life regardless. Thanks",

During the summer I went to get it checked out and got referred to cahms but I haven't heard back yet. And now then for the new school year I was back with mild tics so no one noticed them. It's now half term and they are getting more severe.\n\nNow that they might be more noticeable I'm worried people will notice and start thinking I'm faking it or mock people with tourettes, plus some people in my class are mildly abelist so idk how that will go down.\n\nSo, does anyone know what I can do if someone asks me about my tics and what to do if people call me fake?",

It looks pretty dope with the silencer on :)\nAlso comes with a red dot (and green dot) sight.\n\nThe previous owner also took off the orange cap at the front for the silencer to be put on, but it works fine without the mock silencer as well. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions. And I am only doing pickup near Bayview and Major Mackenzie. \n\nSelling this bundle for a phenomenal price of $140 for the whole thing. Awesome close quarters AEG. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/dfx0FZL",

            "selftext": "My mother is verbally and mentally abusive towards me and has been ever since I was around 7-8, I've always been able to handle it but now after my father has past away almost a month ago I don't see how that will be possible. She threatens to tell people all of the \"bad\" stuff I did from YEARS ago despite me being nothing like how I used to be even regretting some of it. She tries to make people feel bad for her after I open up. I had opened up to my cousin about everything going on and my mother walked in and shook her head. After I was done she goes up to my cousin and tells her one story from years ago to get her on my mothers side. It's ridiculous and childish and I'm so fucking fed up. I can't even open up to people without feeling scared that she might try something. Whenever she starts arguing she threatens to hit me causing me to lock myself in the bathroom, Then she will sometimes threaten to break down the bathroom door to hit me. It gets scary, When I'm locked in the bathroom I'm genuinely afraid she will go into my room and trash it or break my things. These threats are all so stupid and childish but one that I will never let slide is the way she threatened to prevent me from attending school. A public school that I have wanted to attend my WHOLE LIFE as a homeschooled child. She threatened to take away that opportunity over her petty arguing. I had wanted to go to school for years, I opened up to her about it back when I was 11 and at this point I was already severely depressed about school and now to this day she uses me opening about it to mock me in arguments trying to use it as some sort of an insult. Even after years of treating me like this whenever I call her out for it she denies it and tries to say I'm the one in the wrong she's so delusional and there's absolutely no getting through to her. It's so frustrating. No matter what I'm always the one in the wrong never her regardless of what she said. I just can't do it anymore, I need to live with someone else. Someone who doesn't treat me like actual shit. For a week after my dads passing I stayed with my gran, My aunt was practically trying to force me to go home with my mother saying \"she's your mother\" just cause she's my mother doesn't give her the excuse to treat me like fucking shit. I was so pissed hearing that and still am. I know people are going to try and say that and it will stir something up between the family and my mother but I just don't see any other way. I'm already dealing with the loss of my dad who was the one good parent I had and loads of other mental health problems. If I don't get out of here and get myself into a better home and get some therapy I can't promise that I'll still be around in a few years. I just don't know how to get people on my side, Despite my older sister and cousin being on my side I still doubt my aunts are fully there for me. Yes, they're seeing through it but it will take more than that to get what I need because my mother has put on this \"nice mother of the year\" act for YEARS. I just hope people can see through it but it's just so hard. Please give me advice on what to do I really need it right now.",

            "selftext": "What do you dads think of my first complete short story?\n\n\n\nOnce upon a time, in an age before memory, there was a kingdom ruled by a greedy and suspicious king. His every moment was overpowered by fears of intrigue and betrayal. He held all his many possessions under close watch within his fortified castle, keeping constant inventory. He felt that his status as king was tied directly to his possessions. His father was a mighty and respected king whose image he could never live up to, and as such, he coveted his accumulated riches and opulence as the only substance of his kingship. Because he trusted no one, he rotated his guards and counselors regularly, never becoming close or friendly with any. Using his wealth, he promised reward to any in the kingdom who would expose another\u2019s treachery. In this way, he turned his subjects against one another, creating a kingdom of backstabbing and distrust.\n\n\nAs a child, he had never been accepted by other boys, living in the shadows of the castle, always suspecting that their whispers were directed against him. He was loved by no one. Whereas his father was strong and just and the kingdom accepted his rule, the kingdom begrudged the king his riches, which they knew were hidden away, while the peasants lived in squalor and even the upper classes were pitted against each other for the table scraps of the royal table.\n\n\nBut despite all the king\u2019s riches, there was one possession which he desired more than any. In his secret heart of hearts, more secret than any treasure in the depths of his vaults, was a man who ached to shower a child of his own with the purest, richest of love. His heart knew it had been wronged and wished for nothing more than to right the wrongs of his childhood one by one through his own child. He wished for this so strongly that at times, he felt as though this child already existed and had been stolen from him.\n\n\nHis queen feared him in his violent outbursts, but in her closeness to him had glimpsed hints of a buried purity in him. For many years they tried to have a child but never conceived. The king felt that he had been singled out by the gods to suffer, besieged and unfulfilled, but in truth, no woman in his kingdom had given birth to a child in twenty years. His kingdom was known throughout lands far and wide as The Barren. \u201cA pit filled with riches and devoid of laughter,\u201d they whispered with pity and disdain.\n\n\nOn a cool, dark night in late summer, he snuck away from the castle through one of many secret passages out to the rocky shore. The stones glistened under a full moon and rattled under the crashing waves. He walked for many miles, almost unthinking, engrossed in self-pity and desire for a child to heal his wounds until he stumbled on the sliding stones, falling to his knees. As the briny water flowed under his legs he looked up to the moon and beseeched, \u201cOh Moon, you mock me! Your belly fills and births each month in eternity out of reach, while I in my prison have only a wife with eyes empty of love and a belly empty of child.\u201d\n\n\nHe lowered his hands onto the stones and wept, his long beard soaking with salty tears and sea spray. The rocks undulated beneath the waves and a voice like tinkling glass could be heard beneath them. \n\n\n\u201cI could give you the child you desire, but you would only lock him away like some treasure to be coveted. That is no way to raise a child.\u201d\n\n\nThe king groveled and begged pitifully. The voice went on.\n\n\n\u201cI will give you a child, but you will not lock this child away. The moment your child is born, a poor young woman in your kingdom will also give birth. This child will be stillborn and I will replace it with your child instantly. The woman and all others will believe your child to be hers and raise it as such. You will never know who has your child and, I warn you, any attempt to discover this will end in mortal disaster for your child. When your child reaches the age of 16, they will find you, and you both will know the truth. This is the only way you will ever have a child.\u201d\n\n\nThe king agreed to his fate and laughed silently. No child had been conceived in The Barren for so long, it would take no effort at all to locate his.\n\n\nAs the following weeks went by, something very strange became known throughout the land. Hundreds of the kingdom\u2019s poor young women had become pregnant. The kingdom rejoiced and mustered what offerings they could to give thanks to the gods. They assembled a huge festival and The Barren saw color, heard laughter and felt joy in the streets for the first time in many years. Meanwhile, the king despaired, now knowing he had no chance of finding his child. He cursed his fate and the happiness of all those who had finally conceived children. But, his wife had also conceived, and was overcome with both joy and grief, as her husband had told her all about his encounter with the voice on the beach.\n\n\nOver the months, somehow their anticipation and dread drew the king and queen closer together. Knowledge of impending loss narrowed their focus. They spent days in their chambers, with their hands upon her belly, feeling the flutter of the life within, singing and talking to it. He became obsessed with ingraining his voice into the mind of his child, so that someday it might recognize him. The king recited every story he could think of until he ran out of tales and began telling his unborn child stories of his own childhood. He released ages of painful memories, stories of the scorn of his peers, the coldness of his father, his mother\u2019s illness and death. And an unbelievable and unexpected thing happened \u2014 the king ran out of self-pity. His next story was not so much a tale as a prayer. He prayed that his child would be happy, would have many young friends, would be loved dearly by dedicated parents and deep down would know his noble soul.\n\n\nOn the day the child was born, the king had nothing left in him but thanks. To his own surprise, he could offer nothing but gratitude as his wife labored. He promised to wait patiently for the day he would meet his child and thanked the gods for his nine months of intimacy. He locked out all the staff from the chamber and held his hands beneath his wife as she bore down into a final contraction. A child just barely slid into his hands, wet with birth, then vanished.\n\n\nThe king and queen wept together for a long time. He helped her to the wash tub and bathed her gently. He held her for many days, comforting her and reminding her of a future day when they would know their child. The castle attendants all assumed that the child had died.\n\n\nEventually, they ventured out of their bedroom and heard the talk being discussed throughout the castle. On the same day of their child\u2019s birth, hundreds of other children had also been born. The kingdom was overjoyed. But, being mostly very poor, they struggled to care for so many new children.\n\n\nThe king, knowing that his child was among them, but knowing not where, walked solemnly into his vault of riches and knew what he needed to do. Though he had come so far in the preceding nine months, he hesitated. Suspicion grew from the shadows of his mind. What if this was all some trick? What if his child never actually found him? What if his child was dead, stolen by the voice? But something in his heart had shifted. He now had a wife who loved and respected him, with whom he had shared joy and pain. He had a child.\n\n\nHe called for his most moral counselors and his most intelligent advisors and instructed them to develop a sixteen-year program of investing his wealth for the betterment of the peasantry. In shock, they began planning repairs of irrigation, roads, homes and health. When it became clear that there would still be many riches left over, the king instructed them to provide a flat income to every peasant for sixteen years. Raising the standard for every citizen was the only sure way to ensure that his child would have the upbringing they deserved.\n\n\nBut as the king watched the activity in his vault, which had been sealed for so long like the vault of his heart, he knew that this wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\nThe king assembled the kingdom\u2019s most respected poets, songwriters, musicians, headmasters and headmistresses, nuns, priests and schoolteachers. He decreed that all children in his kingdom were to be treated as no less than royalty. They were to be showered with love, attention and respect. Songs of happy childhoods were written and sung through the streets. Poems of loving parents were penned and recited around hearths. Citizens who showed special care to the children of the kingdom were raised as examples. Small acts of kindness to children were openly recognized and praised.\n\n\nThe kingdom turned its attention fully to its children. They walked freely through the streets and were cared for by everyone they met.\n\n\nAll traces of treachery and suspicion left the kingdom as the people shared the privilege of raising their Royal Children. The streets, homes and shops were filled with warmth and laughter.\nThe king himself even left his castle and began occasionally walking the streets, playing with children and shaking hands. \n\n\nFor sixteen years, he watched the Royal Children grow. His heart grew and they all lived inside it. As each day went on, he felt more and more that every child, not just one of them, was his own.\nAnd the people loved their king. There was an almost holy sense among the people that the king had sacrificed his child so that they might all have their own. His generosity supported this rumor. \n\n\nThe Royal Children, having been showered with love, attention, support and respect grew into loving, attentive, supportive and respectful young people. They treated each other fairly and their elders with gratitude. As children not just of parents but of a community, they had the freedom to choose their trades and learned them with passion and diligence. The kingdom flourished as elders had young ones to receive their knowledge. Throughout lands far and wide, The Barren became known as The Kingdom of the Royal Children.\n\n\nThe king decided that on the sixteenth anniversary of the birth of the Royal Children, he would hold a huge festival and give a speech from his royal balcony. After hours of celebration, song, dance and food, a crowd of thousands, some from distant kingdoms who had come to see the magical kingdom, poured around the balcony and awaited the king\u2019s speech. When he stepped into the open, the cheering was deafening. But the king was pensive, almost somber.\n\n\n\u201cOn this day sixteen years ago, I thought I lost a child. For sixteen years hence I have watched our kingdom grow and flourish. I know now that my child is out there with you. You are all the Royal Children of the Kingdom.\u201d The king then told them the story of the voice on the beach, of the pregnancy and birth, and most importantly he told them how proud and grateful he felt to have watched them all grow. As he told his story, his voice drummed like the stones of the shoreline so many years ago. His words, laden with unhindered emotion, carried over the crowd.\n\n\nA young man stepped forward.",

            "selftext": "My mother is verbally and mentally abusive towards me and has been ever since I was around 7-8, I've always been able to handle it but now after my father has past away almost a month ago I don't see how that will be possible. She threatens to tell people all of the \"bad\" stuff I did from YEARS ago despite me being nothing like how I used to be even regretting some of it. She tries to make people feel bad for her after I open up. I had opened up to my cousin about everything going on and my mother walked in and shook her head. After I was done she goes up to my cousin and tells her one story from years ago to get her on my mothers side. It's ridiculous and childish and I'm so fucking fed up. I can't even open up to people without feeling scared that she might try something. Whenever she starts arguing she threatens to hit me causing me to lock myself in the bathroom, Then she will sometimes threaten to break down the bathroom door to hit me. It gets scary, When I'm locked in the bathroom I'm genuinely afraid she will go into my room and trash it or break my things. \n\nThese threats are all so stupid and childish but one that I will never let slide is the way she threatened to prevent me from attending school. A public school that I have wanted to attend my WHOLE LIFE as a homeschooled child. She threatened to take away that opportunity over her petty arguing. I had wanted to go to school for years, I opened up to her about it back when I was 11 and at this point I was already severely depressed about school and now to this day she uses me opening about it to mock me in arguments trying to use it as some sort of an insult. Even after years of treating me like this whenever I call her out for it she denies it and tries to say I'm the one in the wrong she's so delusional and there's absolutely no getting through to her. It's so frustrating. No matter what I'm always the one in the wrong never her regardless of what she said.\n\n I just can't do it anymore, I need to live with someone else. Someone who doesn't treat me like actual shit. For a week after my dads passing I stayed with my gran, My aunt was practically trying to force me to go home with my mother saying \"she's your mother\" just cause she's my mother doesn't give her the excuse to treat me like fucking shit. I was so pissed hearing that and still am. I know people are going to try and say that and it will stir something up between the family and my mother but I just don't see any other way. I'm already dealing with the loss of my dad who was the one good parent I had and loads of other mental health problems. If I don't get out of here and get myself into a better home and get some therapy I can't promise that I'll still be around in a few years. I just don't know how to get people on my side, Despite my older sister and cousin being on my side I still doubt my aunts are fully there for me. Yes, they're seeing through it but it will take more than that to get what I need because my mother has put on this \"nice mother of the year\" act for YEARS. I just hope people can see through it but it's just so hard. Please give me advice on what to do I really need it right now.",
