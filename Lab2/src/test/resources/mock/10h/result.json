            "selftext": "Arthur 'Noble' Kennedy will be in this, but it's going to be in the eyes of Liliana from now on.\n\n\"You made made him leave?\" You asked Six. \"I gave him strict orders to bring Alex in alive. I gave him a direct order and he disobeyed it.\" Six replied. \"Sir. With all due respect, he-\" you started to say. \"Stop Liliana. You know as well as I do that your father did killed him. Let it go.\" Zofia said, warning you with a glare to be quiet.\n\n2 hours later.\n\n\"Mom. Is he really gone? Did he really do it? Did he kill Alex?\" You ask. \"I know he didn't. I know Jack did, but you and I both know your father said he did it for him.\" Zofia said. \"Then why did you let him?\" You ask, and hear a phone calling, which Zofia answers. \"Arthur?\" She asks hopefully. \"Of course Arthur. Here Liliana.\" Zofia says handing the phone to you. \"Da- Dad?\" You stammer. \"Hey kid. Listen, don't be hard on Jack. He's a good man, but I couldn't have him get kicked out. Do not say a word of this to Six. If you need me to send anything to you or Zo, let me know.\" Arthur 'Noble' Kennedy says. \"You wan- want me to just let him be? You just want me to ignore that he got you kicked out?\" You ask. \"He didn't get me kicked out. If I let him take the fall, he would have been kicked out.\" Noble says. \"Tell Jack I said I'm sorry for threatening him. You keep him in shape.\" Noble says, and you hand the phone to Zofia. \"He hung up on me.\" Zofia said, throwing the phone at a wall, breaking it. Zofia got up and walked out, and you followed. She walked over to Jack's room and knocked. Jack opened the door. \"Get out here, we need to talk to you.\" Zofia said, pulling Jack by the collar and closed the door behind him. \"So you just let Arthur take the blame? You just stood by as he got kicked off the team?\" Zofia asked angrily. \"Woah woah woah, calm down. That was his choice.\" \"But you still just stood by and let my daddy get kicked out?\" You asked angrily. \"Listen, if I came clean to Six after he'd told him both of us would be out. He told me to protect you guys, I don't think you'll let me. Believe me I didn't want him to get kicked out, but there's nothing I can do anymore. He wanted to leave, so I'm letting him.\" Jack said, before getting slapped by Zofia. \"You're a coward Jack.\" Zofia said. \"I haven't done anything, it was Arthur's choice. You fuckin' people never believe me, just fuck off and go bitch to someone else.\" Jack said harshly and slamming the door in both you and Zofia's face. \"He's not in good shape mom. Did you see him? He's beating himself up over it and we didn't help at all.\" You say. \"Let him, he's just as bad as your father was when he left.\" Zofia said. \"Do you know what dad said to me? He said to not be hard on Jack. He's a good man. And I want to help dad.\" You say. \"I don't care. Let him sulk and pout. He doesn't give a shit anymore.\" Zofia said.\n\n3 hours later. Six's office.\n\"I want a training match with Alibi, Oryx, Mira, Smoke and Caveira for defense. For attacking I want Buck, Splitter, Thatcher and Zero.\" You say. \"Jack is out of control. Pick someone else.\" Six said. \"Out of control? He's out of control? No, he is perfectly fine.\" You say. \"Pick another person.\" Six said. \"No. I want Jack on my team.\" You reply. \"You are too much like your father.\" Six said. \"That a bad thing or a good thing?\" You ask, leaving and not waiting for a reply.\n\n1 hour later.\n\"Splitter, Liliana, Thatcher, Zero, Buck, Alibi, Mira, Smoke, Oryx and Caveira report to the training ground.\" Six said over the intercom. You grab a FO-12 Shotgun and Noble's personal P228. \"So who's leading this? It's not Thatcher is it?\" Jack asked. \"You're with me Jack.\" You say with a grin. \"Yay.\" Jack said sarcastically.\" 'Really Jacky boy?' You think. \"Round begins in one minute.\" You got ready to attack as the prep phase began. The 45 seconds was up and Jack decided to go in through the basement, so you followed. Jack entered the basement and peeked into the rooms immediately to your side and cleared them. You heard Oryx holding an angle and Jack snuck up behind him and 'slit his throat' with a fake knife \"Dammit.\" Oryx said as he laid down. Jack continued through the hallway, and you followed behind him, watching his back. Jack walked around a corner and saw Smoke, he tried to throw a gas grenade at you but Jack shot it midair and shot him with chalk bullets soon after. After moving down a hallway more you heard a voice in your radio \"I got Mira.\" You turn around and let Jack wander off, baiting yourself out. You listen intently, and turn and eliminate Caveira, saying \"I've got Caveira.\" You run toward where you left Jack. Soon after, it became 5v1, you saw Jack had decided to rush into site and try to eliminate Alibi. Alibi tried to run around the wall and shoot Jack but he ducked behind a desk and then stood up shooting at her, eliminating her. \"Damn good play.\" Jack said, and then walked over and helped Alibi up. Jack walked back and sat his gun down. \"Next time save some kills for me.\" You said as you sat down next to Jack \"Jack, I'm sorry about yesterday. Can we put it in the past please?\" Jack thought for a moment and then got up and said \"No, we can't.\" As he walked out. \"Jack. Do I need to get my father?\" You yell after him. \"Forget it.\" You say, and then go to the gun range.\n\n1 hour later, gun range.\n\nYou turn and see Jack, and then fire another mag. Jack loaded a mag and went to the row farthest down from you. He fired off a mag and went back to his table. \"Y'know, I should just shoot you with this.\" You say, and hear Jack sigh, and he turned towards you. \"Then just fucking kill me already, since apparently it was my fault that Arthur was kicked off.\" He said miserably. \"It was your fault!\" You say, not believing it. Jack walked over and grabbed youe gun and put the barrel to his forehead. \"Then shoot me, put a bullet right in my brain.\" Jack challenged. You paused, wondering if Arthur would forgive you for putting a gun against Jack's forehead. \"You gonna do it? That's what I thought.\" Jack said, slapping your gun to the side and went back to his table. Jack began dissasembling his pistol and saw you were still standing in the same spot, frozen. 'Would dad have pulled the trigger?' You think. Jack sighed and got up, walked over to you and said \"I'm sorry Liliana, I know I've been a piece of shit the last few days. I shouldn't have done that.\" You hear the replacement phone ring and answer it. \"Hello?\" You ask. \"Come to the room. I don't want you talking with Jack.\" Zofia said. \"I'll talk to him if I want.\" You reply defiantly. \"Get your ass back to the room now.\" Zofia said. \"No mom. I'm not going to.\" You reply. \"Put Jack on.\" Zofia commands, and you hand Jack the phone. \"Uh hi?\" Jack said. \"Okay. I will, cool it.\" Jack said, handing the phone back. \"What'd she tell you?\" You asked. \"To stay the fuck away from you, her words not mine.\" Jack said, making you pause for a moment. \"Well don't listen to her.\" You reply. \"I'm going to.\" Jack said, shocking you and packed his guns up. \"See you around Liliana.\" Jack said as he walked out of the room. \"Get your ass back to the room or I'll drag you back.\" Zofia commanded. \"Fine.\" You reply, walking to the room.\n\n3 hours later. Cafeteria.\n\nYou and Zofia start walking to Jack after seeing him enter the cafeteria. \"Like mother like daughter.\" Jack said out loud, this only earned him a glare from Zofia. \"Just speaking the truth.\" Jack said as he walked by you. You watched Zofia walk over and sit across from Jack. \"We need to talk Jack.\" Zofia said. \"No we don't.\" Jack said. \"What the fuck has gotten into you Jack? You used to be a kind man, helping people. Now you're just an asshole, you're turning into Alex.\" Zofia said, making him snap up at Zofia's statement. \"Don't ever fucking compare me to that piece of shit.\" Jack replied angrily. Jack glared at Zofia before he went back to eating. \"You are though. You insult and mock people. You've said horrible things and shattered people.\" Zofia said. Jack just continued eating and ignored what Zofia was saying until she slapped him across the face. \"What the hell was that for?\" Jack asked. \"So you'd listen to me. You can't keep doing this, people need you here. Don't be like Arthur and leave everyone.\" Zofia said. \"Well you know I'm a whole hell of a lot like Arthur, family was killed when I was young. I wanna be left alone but people are always trying to be around me. Maybe I will leave, just start new somewhere else.\" Jack said spitefully. \"But what about Tina?\" Zofia asked. \"She'll move on, she's done it before. All I am to her is a weakness.\" Zofia scoffed and leaned back. \"No, you're something way more to her. She loves you Jack, and I can see that you love her.\" Zofia said. \"It doesn't matter, she'd move on, I'd move on.\" \"What d-doesn't matter?\" Tina said behind Jack. \"Are you breaking up with me?\" Tina asked Jack as tears started to fill her eyes. \"No, that's not what I meant.\" Jack said. Tina ran out of the room before anyone could explain. \"Thanks bitch.\" Jack harshly told Zofia as he got up and left. \"Figured you of all people could help, but no. Just run away like my dad did.\" You say quietly. \"Mom, do you realize what you've done?\" You ask Zofia, before getting up to leave for the garage.\n\n30 minutes later, garage area.\n\n\"Dad. We need you to come clean up the mess we made. It's really bad.\" You say into the phone. \"Rule forty five. What is it?\" Arthur asked. \"Clean up the mess you make. But you also taught me rule twenty eight, which is 'When you need help, ask.' And I'm asking you for help. Please.\" You say, crying. \"No Lily. You have to deal with it yourself. Goodbye. I love you.\" Arthur says. \"It's Jack and Tina.\" You say, hearing him hang up as you say it. \"Everything alright?\" Jack asked you as he walked up to his car, \"Not really, but it's not like you're gonna help.\" You reply. \"You're right kid.\" Jack hopped in his Mustang and started to drive off.",

I understand and respect that you do not mock the religion of Islam and I was wondering what would be a Muslims thoughts on someone openly making fun of Jesus and what would happen in the eastern world or the Islamic community in the west?\n\nIs this mocking of Jesus just because Christianity is about forgiveness and I guess they can get away with it like a target? \n\nI know the same people mocking Jesus would not dare to openly mock Islam or the Prophet Muhammad!\n\nThank you for your input and I apologies if my knowledge is incorrect or I have said any thing that is offensive to ANY religion as that is far from the intention of my questions. \ud83d\ude4f",
