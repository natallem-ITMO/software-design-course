            "selftext": "*Posted previously in r/OCD and r/Psychosis. Sorry for spamming the whole Reddit, bear with me. I'm trying to get as much opinions as possible.*\n\n\nHello. I've had OCD, full blown anxiety and mild depression for a solid 5 years now but I've showed signs of them well before that. During all these years my obsessions have taken so many forms that it'd be difficult for me to list them all. It's worth mentioning I've never gotten it treated, no CBT, no SSRIs, nothing. Got it diagnosed by a specialist but never continued therapy and continued using medication.\n\nFor the last year or so, I've developed a fear of being watched (paranoia). Not exactly fear in the literal meaning of the word but more of a really really uneasy feeling.\n\nOne of my strongest obsessions was the fear of developing schizophrenia later in life. I wouldn't have cared that much if my first cousin hadn't been full blown paranoid schizophrenic and if I hadn't used illicit drugs in the past. My psychiatrist told me the genetic predisposition is negligible. No other family history of psychosis but bipolar and OCD. I'm so so convinced I'm gonna become like my cousin really soon. I constantly compare every action I do to hers and try to avoid her behaviour traits I see in myself as much as possible.\n\n\nHere comes my current obsession - a few months ago I masturbated in my room but forgot to shut my blinds properly (or so I thought). Wouldn't have cared that much if there wasn't that huge apartment complex just fifteen meters in front of my room. Sounds insane but I'm ashamed of looking through that window and into the building outside because of the fear that someone might have seen me and I might get blackmailed with a video of me doing my dirty little secret. Or people might mock me when I'm outside. Not that it couldn't happen if I don't show up on that window too lol. \nI don't think I will survive the following harassment and bullying. I was bullied my entire life, I don't want this to continue. I don't live in the best neighborhood either.  What is even crazier is that I might be so far away from home but if I hear some people laughing near me, my brain would somehow associate it with the stuff I mentioned above. It's ridiculous. I avoid eye contact with people around my neighborhood and have a feeling a lot of people know about my secret, I'm extremely suspicious. If someone looks at me a bit odd, I get a panic attack. Avoiding certain places of my house is a part of the whole game as well. Well, in theory it's possible they *might* know about it but that chance is insanely insanely low. Still, it gives me hellish anxiety. A lot of time has passed since then but the episodes don't subside.\n\nIt sounds literally like paranoia, checked its symptoms and I got them all. I (still) don't have some bizarre beliefs like the aliens are stalking me or the government is trying to poison me but I feel like they might appear soon. My fear is rooted in reality but it just won't go. I will only be at peace if I ask those neighbours in front of me if they have seen anything but this sounds even crazier. I just want to not care and not fear the worst.\n\n\nHow does that sound to you, does it sound like I'm becoming a schizophrenic? As I said, I understand that the chance of the stuff I mentioned happening is quite slim but it still brings me immense amount of anxiety. I hope so so much that it's my social anxiety and OCD presenting themselves in the form of paranoia rather than psychosis. Any help is appreciated, I'm desperate.",

            "selftext": "There he is. It just annoyed me we didn't get to see of him. Well let's start. \n\nBackstory Part 1: Bj\u00f6rn(got no better name and in this rewrite he is a bear faunus) was one of many workers in a SDC mine outside of the kingdoms. Growing up between Grimm attacks and experiments on faunus he tried his best to protect his kind. Without success. His family died during an experiment only he survived and afterwards, as if to mock him the guards branded the SDC sign on his back. A fire was ignited that day, full of hatred and rage. Over the years the fire grew and with it he. Standing head and shoulders over anyone in the cave he was a terrifying sight. One day a Grimm attack to large for the guards to fend of and they used the faunus as meatshields. Bj\u00f6rn, who unlocked his Aura during the battle, was the only survivor. He gathered a pickaxe and a gun and left the place he called home for 19 years. Not long after that rumors spread about a giant huntsmen killer who fought with a stolen huntsman weapon, a chainsaw. \n\nBackstory Part 2: Six years passed and Bj\u00f6rn had joined the White Fang, working his way up to the Lieutenant rank. He heard of the former leaders of the Fang and was disgusted. They were weak. You don't survive outside of the kingdoms when you are weak. Their daughter, Blake was here. He didn't trust her. Perhaps she was also weak in his eyes. But he trusted the judgment of Adam Taurus, his leader.\n\nVol 1: Let Blake mention him as Adams' most trusted  soldier and establish him as a great threat.\n\nVol 2: Let him go up against Yang, Weiss and Blake to show the sheer difference between an individual who kills huntsmen on daily basis and three huntresses in training. (I know it would let the main characters seem weak but it was stated that if you grow up outside of the kingdoms alone, you have to be though.)\n\nVol 3: Show him on one the bullheads, overseeing the chaos. He doesn't have to be on screen very much.\n\nPowerset: Very strong and experienced fighter. While he has no huntsman training, he learned to fight in live and death situations and always came out in top. His semblance is air related. As long as he holds his breath he can take absurd levels of hits, without taking damage.\n\n\nPhew. That was the longest text I have ever written on Reddit. Hope you it. There will be a part 2 of him but don't know if I should rewrite another character first. Eh, the future will show it. Anyways as for why he seems this much stronger in this, as he is in Canon I just wanted to show that he is an elite fighter. One of the best the White Fang has to offer. And last but not least I wanted to make Adam a even bigger threat. But what are your thoughts?",
