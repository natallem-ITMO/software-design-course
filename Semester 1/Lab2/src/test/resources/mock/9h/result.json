            "selftext": "You awoke to the sound of angry knocking at your door \"Coming\" You yelled as you slowly pushed a now awake Tina off of you. You opened the door to an angry Zofia and Lilliana \"Get out here, we need to talk to you\" Zofia yanked you by your collar and closed the door behind you. \"So you just let Arthur take the blame? You just stood by as he got kicked off the team?\" You could barely process what was happening, since you just woke up. \"Woah woah woah, calm down. That was his choice\" \"But you still just stood by and let my daddy get kicked out?\" Lilliana asked angrily \"Listen, if I came clean to Six after he'd told him both of us would be out. He told me to protect you guys, I don't think you'll let me. Believe me I didn't want him to get kicked out, but there's nothing I can do anymore. He wanted to leave, so I'm letting him\" After this you earned a slap from Zofia \"You're a coward Jack\" \"I haven't done anything, it was Arthur's choice. You fuckin people never believe me, just fuck off and go bitch to someone else\" Your words were harsh, and slamming the door in their face was even harsher but you didn't care.\n\n\r  \n\"What was that all about?\" Tina rounded the corner and asked you \"Just some people who don't believe me, no one here ever fucking does\" You sat down on the couch, defeated \"I believe you\" Tina said as she sat down next to you. \"Thank you\" You sat for a bit staring at her. After a bit you chuckled to yourself \"What? Are you laughing at me?\" Tina asked you \"No, I just find it funny how a fuckin idiot like me scored such a great girl like you\" Tina began to blush \"Beautiful, smart, kind. You're perfect\" You pulled her in for a passionate kiss and then you cuddled on the couch for a while.\n\n\r  \n\\*Later that day\\*\n\n\r  \nYou got a call from Six \"There's a training match, You'll be on defense. Head down to the training area\" You groaned and hung up \"What's the matter\" Tina asked you as you put your gear on \"There's a training match, I guess I gotta go do it\" You grabbed your practice guns and headed down.\n\n\r  \n\\*15 minutes later\\*\n\n\r  \nAfter some chatting you saw Lilliana walk in. \"You're with me Jack\" She seemed way too happy. Sarcastically you said \"Yay\" She gave you the \"really?\" face. \"Round begins in one minute\" You got ready to attack as the prep phase began. The 45 seconds was up and you decided to go in through the basement, Lilliana seemed to be following you everywhere. You entered the basement and peeked into the rooms immediately to your side and cleared them. Lilliana seemed to be doing almost everything you were doing. You ignored it and headed up the stairs silently. You saw Oryx holding an angle and you snuck up behind him and 'slit his throat' with a fake knife \"Dammit\" he said as he laid down. You continued through the hallway, Lilliana behind you, watching your back. You walked around a corner and saw Smoke, he tried to throw a gas grenade at you but you shot it midair and shot him with chalk bullets soon after. After moving down a hallway more you heard a voice in your radio \"I got Mira\" and another one say \"I got Caveira\" Soon after. It was 5v1, you decided to rush into site and try to eliminate Alibi. You shot one of her gadgets, revealing your location. She tried to run around the wall and shoot you but you ducked behind a desk and then stood up shooting at her, eliminating her. \"Damn good play\" You walked over and helped Alibi up. You walked out and set your gun down and sat down.\n\n\r  \n\"Next time save some kills for me\" Lilliana said as she sat down next to you \"Jack, I'm sorry about yesterday. Can we put it in the past please?\" You thought for a moment and then got up and said \"No, we can't\" as you walked out.\n\n\r  \n\\*Next Day\\*\n\n\r  \nYou'd finished your daily run and decided to go to the shooting range. You grabbed your M16 and 1911 and headed down. As you were almost in, you saw Lilliana was inside shooting. \"Fuckin' hell, now I gotta worry about getting shot\" You walked in and set down your pistol case. Lilliana noticed you and gave you the side eye before going back to shooting. You loaded a mag and went to the row farthest down from her. You fired off your mag and went back to your table \"Y'know, I should just shoot you with this\" You sighed and turned towards Lilliana \"Then just fucking kill me already, since apparently it was my fault that Arthur was kicked off\" \"It was your fault!\" You walked over and grabbed her gun and put the barrel to your forehead. \"Then shoot me, put a bullet right in my brain.\" There was a long pause with Lilliana frozen, with a gun against your forehead \"You gonna do it? That's what I thought\" You slapped the gun to the side and went back to your table. You began disassembling your pistol and saw Lilliana was still standing in the same spot, frozen. You sighed and got up, walked over to her and said \"I'm sorry Lilliana, I know I've been a piece of shit the last few days. I shouldn't have done that\" Shortly after you apologized Lilliana's phone rang \"Hello?\" You heard talking through the phone but it was too quiet to tell what they were saying \"I'll talk to him if I want\" She seemed to be talking about you \"No mom I'm not going to\" She listened a bit more and handed the phone to you \"Uh hi?\" You asked into the phone \"Stay the fuck away from my daughter you degenerate\" It was Zofia, apparently she was upset that you were talking to Lilliana \"Ok, I will. Cool it\" You handed the phone back to Lilliana and she said \"You'll have to find me first\"\n\n\r  \n\"What'd she tell you?\" Lilliana asked \"To stay the fuck away from you, her words not mine\" Lilliana paused for a moment \"Well don't listen to her\" You thought for a moment \"I'm going to\" You shocked Lilliana with your words and packed your guns up. \"Cya around Lilliana\" You said as you walked out of the room.\n\n\r  \n\\*Next day\\*\n\n\r  \nYou got done with your daily run that you decided to make longer than normal and headed to the cafeteria to get some lunch. As you were walking you saw Zofia and her daughter walking towards you, Zofia gave you a side eye and Lilliana did the same \"Like mother like daughter\" You said out loud, this only earned you a glare from Zofia \"Just speaking the truth\" You said as you walked by them. You got to the mess hall, grabbed a burrito and some water and then sat down to eat. As you were eating you heard some footsteps walk in behind you, you turned around to see Zofa. She walked over and sat down across the table from you. \"We need to talk Jack\" \"No we don't\" You ignored her and went back to eating. \"What the fuck has gotten into you Jack? You used to be a kind man, helping people. Now you're just an asshole, you're turning into Alex\" You snapped up at Zofia's statement \"Don't ever fucking compare me to that piece of shit\" You glared at Zofia before you went back to eating \"You are though, you insult and mock people. You've said horrible things and shattered people\" You continued eating and ignored what she was saying until you got a slap across the face \"What the hell was that for??\" \"So you'd listen to me. You can't keep doing this, people need you here. Don't be like Arthur and leave everyone\" \"Well you know I'm a whole hell of a lot like Arthur, family was killed when I was young, I wanna be left alone but people are always trying to be around me. Maybe I will leave, just start new somewhere else\" \"But what about Tina?\" Even though Zofia didn't like you she still wanted you to stay \"She'll move on, she's done it before. All I am to her is a weakness\" Zofia scoffed and leaned back \"No, you're something way more to her. She loves you Jack, and I can see that you love her\" You didn't like how spot on Zofia was being \"It doesn't matter, she'd move on, I'd move on\" \"What d-doesn't matter?\" You heard Tina's voice behind you and realized that she'd been listening to your conversation. You'd been trapped, you didn't have any options.\n\n\r  \n\"Are you breaking up with me?\" Tina asked as tears started to fill her eyes \"No, that's not what I meant\" Tina ran out of the room before you could explain \"Thanks bitch\" You harshly told Zofia as you got up and left, but not after Tina. You decided to go for a drive, so you headed to the garage where you saw Lilliana, she was on the phone and seemed to be crying. She hung up as you walked in. \"Everything alright?\" You asked her as you walked up to your car \"Not really, but it's not like you're gonna help\" \"You're right kid\" You hopped in your Mustang and started to drive off. You left the garage and headed for the 'Memory Loss' bar to get a light drink. \n\n\r  \n\\*17 minutes later\\*\n\n\r  \nYou got to the bar, parked and went inside. Madison was there getting a drink. \"Oh hi Jack, didn't expect to see you here again\" \"Yeah the feelings mutual\" You didn't want to talk to her and just got a beer. \"What's wrong Jack?\" Madison asked as she scooted over into a seat closer to you \"What's wrong is none of your fucking business\" You replied harshly as you started to drink, Madison just kept to herself until you left. Once into your car, you decided to go to your mountain spot to think.\n\n\r  \n\\*30 minutes later\\*\n\n\r  \nYou pulled over and walked through the woods to your mountain spot and sat down against the rock that was always your little chair. You began to think of what you should do, you weren't in good graces with Tina and she'd probably leave you anyways. Zofia and Lilliana were pissed at you, Noble wasn't there. You felt like you didn't have anyone to turn to. \"Maybe I will just l leave, Tina probably hates me. I know Zofia and Lilliana hate me. I think it'd be for the better\" You thought to yourself before getting up and heading back to the apartment, you knew it'd be a painful interaction as you walked into the apartment. \n\n\r  \nYou walked in and heard Tina crying from the bedroom, against your better judgement you walked in and sat on the bed next to her. \"I'm sorry babe, I'm not breaking up with you I promise\" You tried to put your arm around her but she slapped it away. You thought for a moment about what to say next, but you couldn't come up with anything. \"I'm gonna sleep on the couch tonight and then tomorrow we can get different rooms if you want\" You told Tina as you walked out and got ready for an uncomfortable night on the couch. \n\n\r  \n\\*Next day\\*\n\n\r  \nYou woke up before Tina and decided to go to Six's office to resign. \"Sir?\" You asked after knocking and being told to come in. \"What is it Jack?\" You sighed and sat down \"I was the one who killed Alex, Arthur took the blame for me and I let him. You don't need to kick me out though as I am resigning from my position on Team Rainbow\" Six was shocked by your words \"You can't possibly mean that Jack\" Six said as he leaned forward \"I do sir, I cannot bear it here anymore. Let Tina keep the apartment, she deserves it\" \"Jack, you must give me a good reason\" Six said as he was still shocked by you leaving \"I'm broken sir, I cannot take the constant stress and it is too much for me. I am weak and a quitter, I drag the people here down and nothing else\" Six nodded and said \"I'll be sad to see you go, but if it's what you truly want then I can do nothing to stop you. Goodbye and good luck Jack\" \"Goodbye sir\" You headed back to the apartment to break the news to Tina.\n\n\r  \n\\*5 minutes later\\*\n\n\r  \nAfter preparing yourself for 3 minutes outside of the door you went in, ready to tell Tina you were leaving. \"Hey Tina you in here?\" You asked out as you shut the door. \"Go away\" A muffled voice came from the bedroom. You walked over and went in. \"Tina, I know you're upset at me. I'm leaving, you don't ever have to see my face again\" Tina looked up at you and couldn't react properly. \"Then just leave, Zofia's right. You are a coward and you are like Alex\" Tina's words hurt you but you didn't retaliate. \"Let me pack my things and I'll be gone, you'll never see me again, I give you my word\" \"Your word? Your word is just empty lies\" You were sad to be insulted by the girl you loved, and once loved you. \"I'll be far away\" You said as you started to pack your things. You saw the pistol that Tina gave you for your birthday. \"Here you can have this back\" You tossed the gun case on to the bed. \"What am I supposed to do with this?\" \"Sell it or something\" You continued to pack your things and after a while you were done.\n\n\r  \n\\*56 minutes later\\* \n\n\r  \n\"Well that's all my stuff, goodbye Tina\" You said as you laid down your key for the apartment \"So you're really leaving, just like that?\" Tina scoffed as you nodded \"Then go already, fuck you\" You looked down at the ground and left. You walked to the garage and ran into Zofia and Lilliana \"Where are you going?\" Lilliana asked as she noticed your bags \"I'm gone, forever long\" You said as you walked to the garage. \"You can't leave\" Zofia said, chasing after you \"I can\" You got to your car and Lilliana and Zofia were right there \"What about Tina?\" Lilliana asked as you loaded your stuff into your truck. \"Tina hates me anyways\" You loaded your last bag and threw Lilliana the keys for your Mustang \"Your dad gave me this car, I'm giving it back\" You say as Lilliana looked at the keys \"I can't take this\" \"You can, give it to your dad sometime or keep it, I don't care\" You hopped in your truck and started it. Zofia banged on the window and motioned for you to roll it down \"You can't leave Jack, you can't\" You sighed and looked down and then back at Zofia \"Why not? Everyone here hates me and I do more harm than good\" Zofia stammered but you rolled up the window and drove off, heading for Utah.\n\n\r  \n\\*2 days later\\* \n\n\r  \nYou arrived in Mount Pleasant, Utah. It's what you randomly got when you closed your eyes and pointed to a place on a map. You drove through the town and out into some back roads looking for a property to buy, you'd brought almost half a million dollars with you that you'd earned from working for Rainbow. \n\n\r  \n\\*42 minutes later\\*\n\n\r  \nYou found a for sale sign on a small farm property \"200 acres for sale\" Is what the sign read. You called the number on the sign and asked what the asking price was \"The previous owner's are asking 350 thousand USD\" The realtor told you \"I'll take it\" It'd leave you with around 120k, plenty to take care of you for a while until you could get a 'normal' job. \n\n\r  \n\\*2 days later\\*\n\n\r  \nYou had been staying in a hotel room while you got the land in your name. You signed the last papers and headed to your new property. You drove down the dusty dirt road to your new house and parked in front, next to a post that at one time would have been used to tie horses up. You hopped out and drug your stuff into the small house and got settled in. You wanted to explore but you decided you needed a better vehicle first. \n\n\r  \n\\*1 day later\\*\n\n\r  \nYou found a perfect vehicle for what you wanted, it was a dune buggy called a 'sandrail'. It was light blue and had orange shock absorbers and rims. You went to take a look at it since it was just one town over. When you got to the house the man who was selling it was waiting outside for you. It was even nicer in person. It had a nice paint job and it was clean, it had 2 front led lights and another light bar on top. It was fully decked out, it was impressive what had been done to it since it was homemade. After some looking over it you told the man you'd take it, you loaded it onto the trailer behind your truck and took off. \n\n\r  \n\\*1 hour later\\*\n\n\r  \nYou'd stopped by Big R and got some coveralls and a helmet for driving your new dune buggy. You got home, unloaded it, changed and started it up. It was an engine from a Volkswagen bug but it still sounded nice due to the short and wide tailpipe. You let it warm up for about 20 seconds and then took off, you began testing the limits, you saw the speedometer climbing to 40 and you felt the turbocharger kick in and the rpms went higher, you shifted and got up to 70 before slowing down to make sure you didn't hit anything. You covered about half of your property and headed back to your house, you would continue in the morning. \n\n\r  \n\\*20 minutes later\\*\n\n\r  \nYou pulled up in front of your house and shut your buggy off, then headed inside to go to sleep.\r  \n\r  \nThis is NOT the end of the story so don't worry",
