            "selftext": "I've been thinking a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrying to figure things out, make sense of what I've been seeing, and I've been asking myself why my department at SUA is the way it is.\n\nI'm starting to coalesce around an idea: ideological discourses. I'm still trying to find the vocabulary to describe what I see, so please jump in with your own descriptions if you can. I live by the mantra that if you know something's name, then you have power over it.\n\nThe experience offered by u/Blanchefromage regarding [death marches (in project management terms)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/qbrxev/comment/hhbtazv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [the import of said death marches from Japanese culture into SUA campus culture via the SGI leadership](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/qbrxev/comment/hhdg3ym/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) has had me thinking deeply about what I've been seeing in my workplace at SUA. I'm referring specifically to the following quotes from our moderator:\n\n&gt;We saw that with the [Arnold Toynbee \"dialogue\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/9hwq45/the_toynbeeikeda_dialogues_incompetent/), where Ikeda's incompetent Soka Gakkai translators simply didn't have enough grasp of the Engrish language to do the job. Notice that this wasn't *THEIR* fault; Ikeda simply didn't do his due diligence, didn't prepare properly, and in the end, nearly caused this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to crash and burn. **As for the hapless Soka Gakkai members who'd been dragooned into this thankless** [**death march**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march_%28project_management%29) **(in project management terms); Ikeda simply held their faces to the fire** ***and BLAMED THEM*** **instead of** ***recognizing*** **the problem,** ***acknowledging*** **the problem, and** ***taking rational action*** **in hiring competent** ***outside*** **translators,** ***which were available***\\*\\*. This is a common thread running through the Ikeda cult's existence - Ikeda sets unrealistic goals and objectives, sets the SGI membership up for failure, and then\\*\\* ***blames THEM*** **when they predictably fail.**\n\nand then:\n\n&gt;I would guess \"import from Japanese culture via SGI\". We saw this sort of thing - large productions and performances with key details left until the very last minute, **\"Oh no! We've got a CRISIS!\" and lots of scurrying around and panic, and then the catharsis \"Oh** ***JOY*** **it happened!\" Everything is always like that in SGI.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy department at SUA has thus far perplexed me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEver since I was hired, I noticed immediately that it was set up to create the most work possible for everyone involved. The director rushes around every day there, seemingly *just barely* holding it together due to the vast amount of variables that this person needs to juggle. The thing is, I know that the director has been there for 30 years. It's normal for long-time employees or directors to have set procedures for an academic department. After 30 years in the same place, you're supposed to have an idea of what you're doing beyond *throwing things together last minute and barely holding it together*.\n\nI admittedly don't know all of the stakeholders involved in the department's processes (is there someone above my director, with certain requirements?), but the director has elaborate explanations for departmental processes that don't make sense beyond the surface level. I'd think if there was another requirement or stakeholder responsible for the way of things, the director could made that clear instead of the elaborate excuses that everyone else is apparently stupid enough to believe.\n\nSo why does the director arrange the department in a way that forces everyone (lecturers, support staff, students) to work exponentially more, while accomplishing much less? The work we are able to do must be done in a frantic, rushed manner, and the product is half-assed nonsensical artifacts that barely squeak by. I describe our department as being run like a [\"Rube Goldberg\" machine, like in the old looney toons cartoons](https://youtu.be/GvnEBX9aedY).\n\nIt's not just my department that runs like this mind you. I would love so much if another employee, former or current, could reach out with their own experiences, **but it's the whole damn school**. But why? Why does the school work harder and not smarter, as a general rule? Is it bad management, individual personalities, or a dysfunction that plagues many of the schools and organizations I've worked with?\n\nWhen Blanchefromage shared the insight above about SGI work culture, my mind started working.\n\nWe all know their aggressive messaging that they are not SGI affiliated is bunk. Even officially and publicly, the SGI is proudly displayed as THE major financial backer of the school. The school displays the names of contributors  throughout the property; in addition to private individuals and occasionally Japanese businesses, there will be \"SGI Malaysia\", \"SGI Singapore\", \"SGI Taiwan\", \"SGI USA\", and other SGI affiliated groups that don't always have \"SGI\" in their name. The school's executive board is, again officially and publicly, filled with SGI leaders (and are advertised as per their formal titles: \"Vice President of SGI-USA\", and so forth). The financial meetings brag openly at how generous SGI donors are from around the world, and how they directly support the school (interestingly, in this case \"SGI\" isn't named; they are just called \"worldwide donors\"). Faculty, staff, and student discussion events tend to revolve heavily around anything that Daisaku Ikeda is personally affiliated with, even if he's presented as off to the side; his inspirational quotes need to be sprinkled everywhere.\n\nOf course I don't see any of those assholes supporting ANY type of education beyond their own reach. If it doesn't benefit them personally, they don't do it.\n\nSoka University is an SGI school, serving SGI interests. However, they keep that affiliation FAR AWAY at the ground level. The org never even comes up during the day-to-day. The school got in trouble for that affiliation over the years, so they need to keep it far, far away lest they come into even more legal trouble and negative attention.\n\nWhat we see every day, instead of an SGI (or \"Buddhist\") school, is **the SGI's honest attempt at running a secular institution**. I understand that the school is engaged in money laundering and shady business dealings at the executive level, but **most people** don't come into contact with any of that. The nature of the endowment is (ironically enough) kept away from almost all employees and all students. The nitty gritty of the school's political aspirations (they want to be another BYU, Biola, HBCU, or Ivy League equivalent in order to have a similar level of influence in US politics) is completely absent from most everyone's field of vision. **The school is run by sincere, hard working individuals who think they are serving a legitimate purpose.** My previous post \"[A Quixotic preparation in a Melvillian Institution](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/q8yzx6/a_quixotic_preparation_in_a_melvillian/)\" attempted to touch on this aspect of SUA; we're all doing real work, though being led by nefarious actors whom we never meet nor have any contact with.\n\nTo put it another way: **SUA is a school that desperately tries to be secular in order to embed itself into larger society, but inevitably (and unconsciously) carries with it the habits, patterns, and culture of its parent organization the SGI**.\n\nAfter putting two-and-two together with the help of this sub, I've come to realize that the dysfunction I see within the culture of the school takes the form of a term that I am coining: **\"The pathology of the ideal.\"** I'm inspired both by negative student reviews, and by writer Chris Hedges.\n\nChris Hedges describes the pathologies of American Empire and imperialism in his article \"[Our Mania for Hope is a Curse](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/05/25/our-mania-hope-curse).\"\n\nSays Hedges:\n\n&gt;The na\u00efve belief that history is linear, that moral progress accompanies technical progress, is a form of collective self-delusion. It cripples our capacity for radical action and lulls us into a false sense of security. Those who cling to the myth of human progress, who believe that the world inevitably moves toward a higher material and moral state, are held captive by power.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The yearning for positivism that pervades our corporate culture ignores human nature and human history. But to challenge it, to state the obvious fact that things are getting worse, and may soon get much worse, is to be tossed out of the circle of magical thinking that defines American and much of Western culture. The left is as infected with this mania for hope as the right. It is a mania that obscures reality even as global capitalism disintegrates and the ecosystem unravels, potentially dooming us all.\u00a0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The blundering history of the human race is always given coherence by power elites and their courtiers in the press and academia who endow it with a meaning and coherence it lacks. **They need to manufacture national myths to hide the greed, violence and stupidity that characterize the march of most human societies**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Wisdom is about transcendence. Wisdom allows us to see and accept reality, no matter how bleak that reality may be. It is only through wisdom that we are able to cope with the messiness and absurdity of life. Wisdom is about detachment. Once wisdom is achieved, the idea of moral progress is obliterated... **systems of power fear and seek to silence those who achieve wisdom, which is what the war by corporate forces against the humanities and art is about. Wisdom, because it sees through the fa\u00e7ade, is a threat to power. It exposes the lies and ideologies that power uses to maintain its privilege and its warped ideology of progress**.  Knowledge does not lead to wisdom. Knowledge is more often a tool for repression. **Knowledge, through the careful selection and manipulation of facts, gives a false unity to reality. It creates a fictitious collective memory and narrative. It manufactures abstract concepts of honor, glory, heroism, duty and destiny that buttress the power of the state, feed the disease of nationalism and call for blind obedience in the name of patriotism.** It allows human beings to explain the advances and reverses in human achievement and morality, as well as the process of birth and decay in the natural world, as parts of a vast movement forward in time. **The collective enthusiasm for manufactured national and personal narratives, which is a form of self-exaltation, blots out reality. The myths we create that foster a fictitious hope and false sense of superiority are celebrations of ourselves. They mock wisdom. And they keep us passive.**\n\nThe negative student reviews call to mind a similar pathology pervading the institution:\n\nFrom [niche.com](https://www.niche.com/colleges/soka-university-of-america/reviews/)\n\n&gt;Don't go to a school a school based on the positive vibes you get from it, because that's probably the only thing drawing you here, and after 4 years you will realize it's all fake anyway. **You think you want to be with \"global-minded\" students? Go to a good school where you can get a job doing global-minded things whatever that may be. Don't go to soka just because the people there claim to care about the world.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While there are a lot of different people, many want everyone to act the same: be quiet during day, go to parties, study a lot. **You feel a little judged if you don't follow these things.** It's kinda awkward sometimes.\n\nFrom[indeed.com (employee reviews)](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Soka-University-of-America/reviews?fcountry=ALL&amp;ftopic=mgmt)\n\n&gt;If you belong to a certain organization, then one can get promoted even if you're not qualified. Otherwise, good luck. ***They're mostly concerned with their image and the rhetoric doesn't match the deeds or lack thereof.*** They need to learn how to become good local citizens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom [Collegesimply.com](https://www.collegesimply.com/colleges/california/soka-university-of-america/reviews/)\n\n&gt;We have such easy access to all of our professors, as our class size exceed no more than 15 students. **However, the culture of activism is so weak. Most people, though self-proclaimed \"global citizens\" only care about the world in the abstract, but ignore the day-to-day social (racial, gendered, sexual, class, etc) issues that exist even on our campus.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have come to realize that the culture on-campus at SUA has what I've come to call the pathology of the ideal. One may also call it a form of cognitive dissonance, resulting from the discrepancy between what they think they should be, and what they actually are.\n\n*We must all strive for, and fight towards the idealized vision the university, and department directors, have for programs. Only the ideal is acceptable*. Voice is not given to the everyday realities that I (and others) see before me.\n\nAnd so we have departments run to force the most work possible out of everyone involved, *because that's how effective departments are run, right? If you're not pushing the limit of having a nervous breakdown, then you're not trying! Forget the substance; we care only about the form here. The product doesn't matter, only the process. If it looks good, that's us.*\n\nThe pathology of the ideal shuns dirty, messy reality in a Jungian sense. *Reality is our insecurity, and to articulate reality is to show our insecurities to the world. So instead we put on a strong face, and portray ourselves in a rosy light. We fight desperately against those cracks of weakness by pretending they are not there, because to give them their real name would be to give them power, and to give them power would make us weak.*\n\n*We dress ourselves up with the pathology of the ideal, not because we want to live in denial, not because we want to operate below optimum capacity, nor because we're trying to fleece or lie to anyone.* ***The pathology of the ideal is the one tool we know how to use****. If we don't use it, then we're losers; we're not losers though, we are the champions, no time for losers!* \n\nIf I've said this once, I'll say it twice, and I'll say it again a thousand times. From what I've seen of the education at Soka University, the students are not significantly challenged through critical thinking or ambiguous values. The students in are indoctrinated into a specific feelgood, kumbaya, Oprah-Winfrey-book-club editorial perspective, and have the same slogans and buzzwords repeated during our time there. I have actually been discouraged from introducing topics directly relevant to students lives, in favor of more rote memorization and Oprah Winfrey book club books. The students then can repeat their call-and-response ideology to an outside world who has never heard of Daisaku Ikeda, even though he made an award in which he appears with Mohandas Ghandi and Martin Luthor King jr. on a medallion. \n\nThe long-standing academic departments in turn know how to do things from one perspective: have students do as much busy-work as possible in order to simulate academic rigor, and call them stupid when or if they don't do well on it. \n\nThe students know what's up on a certain level, but they just don't have the lexicon, nor ability to describe what they're feeling. **If they're not doing it the SUA way, they're doing it the wrong way**.",

            "selftext": "Hello pmp sub, hope your weekend is going well.\n\nPassed ATx3 a few hours ago and thought it important enough to post my experience for your use before celebrating. I want to thank the sub Mods and folks who stay after passing to encourage PMP exam candidates. For doing this service, I salute you and am humbled by your selfless service resulting in the best online experience. This support/ study group has been critical to my success and I hope it is for you all as well. Having said that...\n\n**Study Resources:**\n\n* I started with Study Hall and stuck with it despite a lot of -ve comments. Not discounting other people's experience, which is valid but if you care to hear me out:\n   * Use SH for understanding the content from PMI's perspective, added benefit was all the reference material provided for further study. This help me avoid Googling randomly.\n   * How SH was helpful during my prep in following ways:\n      * Simulated actual Exam experience w.r.t. verbiage, average length of q and mix of agile vs predictive qs by 3 major domain i.e. people/ process/ business environment\n      * Review of incorrect response improved my understanding incrementally\n      * Surfaced areas for further focused study\n      * Made me aware of need for time management\n   * SH per my understanding was the single resource that provided full spectrum learning experience. Although, you might need to go through the already much talked about process of dealing w/ incorrect response explanation but wasn't a deal breaker for me\n   * I felt prepared as far as the ECO after finishing SH guided learning path\n   * You have to take all mocks and both 4 hours full mocks to get into the zone. \"This is the way\" at least for me\n   * Got AR's new exam sim and found it useful from mindset POV. Scored 70, 76, 85 &amp; 79 on 4 mocks\n   * [RV's PMBOK 6 Process video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC7pN8Mjot8&amp;list=PLMqBtftK0dFjWAVMIXA-5D8RjzB1lgGUQ&amp;index=4) should be included in the Library of Congress :-) \n      * I actually got it printed on a posted from FedEx, you probably don't need to do that because didn't have ITTO qs but you should be able to close your eyes and visualize the interplay of 49 processes, if you are can't you may not be ready. I used A3 size paper to flow chart and kept repeating till it was etched on my brain\n   * For some reason this [EV formula video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy1P784tKG8) was the most memorable\n   * I found this [time management video from Ray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bw2HKqT7DE) very helpful, although, as you'll find later in my post, I didn't do well on time management\n   * I found this [integrated change control video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dawt8dRlutI) the best explanation on the topic, also by Ray\n   * I recommend readaing the Agile Study guide thoroughly twice to internalize the agile topics if you are new to agile\n   * I used PMBOK 6 as a reference to look up a few topics e.g. Risk etc\n\n**Exam Experience:**\n\n* The exam felt tougher than I expected, especially compared to AR's mocks. Exam was comparable to SH\n* I  spent, 107/63/ 59 = total 229 minutes on the exam\n\n**Suggested Prep Roadmap:**\n\nStep # 1: \n\nCreate a table / chart in Excel or any other Spreadsheet that you can track for actual vs planned learning progress using a metric that you can define e.g. expected average end of week score on mock exams etc.\n\n* It will be great if you have a weekly milestone e.g. I had 45% to 55% Week 1 and so on\n* Collect, collate and summarize useful recommendations from other folks who passed in past few months\n\nStep #2: \n\nClear out your Calendar for deep study during weekends (10 to 20hrs) + weekdays (2hrs) if you are a working professional, otherwise, feel free to tailor accordingly\n\nStep # 3 (Optional)\n\n* I found creating my own index cards as one of the best decision in hindsight because the day before the exam I just reviewed all by cards in an hour and I was done. I used 5inchx3inch spiral bound cards.\n* I noted major items e.g. all motivational theories etc. \n* Only one topic /card\n* I created five booklets for important areas e.g Risk; Agile etc\n\nStep #4: \n\n* Set an Exam date ETA that was the single most important thing I did. Set reasonable date based on your experience in project management and your familiarity levels with the corpus of knowledge\n\nStep # 5:\n\n* Track your progress on a weekly basis. Modify your learning schedule accordingly\n* Stay focused, don't change your study resources/ plan based on feedback from other folks passing the exam, although you should incorporate what makes sense\n\nStep # 6:\n\n* Preferably, take full mocks during the same scheduled time period as your scheduled exam time. If you can't that's fine. I did that and found it helped to naturally focus my mind\n* Also, don't over-study non-stop for days at a time. otherwise you might get burnt out, pace yourself\n\nStep #7:\n\n* Celebrate after you pass, it's a huge achievement.\n\nCheers and Goodluck to you all!",

            "selftext": "I want to move away from my friend with BPD. I\u2019ve known them for two years and it has been an emotional roller coaster. I saw all the red flags but I kept telling myself they just needed a friend and that if I set up proper boundaries they will respect and understand where I was coming from. I told myself that when they were being negative it was coming from a place of insecurity and to try and make them feel secure. I told myself I would not be the person to abandon them since all of their other friends left.\n\nIt started with teasing and then progressed into verbal abuse. Everything I did was worth criticizing. My appearance, clothes, house, career, the car I drive! Everything! Everything that I had that they wanted needed to be torn apart. Next came the imitation and it was disturbing.  Got a new hairstyle? They had it by the end of week.  Hobbies?  They suddenly jumped on the bandwagon.  Any talents? They were in an internal competition with me and had to be better.  If they weren't better than me, it needed to be destroyed. They once spent a weekend trying to change their career path to match mine. When they came to realize it wasn\u2019t going to work, they tried to find an occupation that would eliminate my job. When that didn\u2019t work out, they fell into their habit of shouting abuses until it feels better. How do I know this happened? They told me they did it after one of their episodes. I don\u2019t understand why they always wanted to emulate me while hating me at the same time. They\u2019d always say they were the victim and that everyone else was a bully. If I tried to stand up for myself, they\u2019d childishly mock me and ask if I was being sensitive.   \n\nI\u2019ve already started pulling away and may have even just ended the friendship. I stopped talking about my personal life and any interests I have as this was just fuel for them. It is when they started lashing out at my SO and child that I snapped. I went off on them and finally got to say everything I've always wanted. The look they gave was unsettling. They weren\u2019t looking at me but through me, like their mind was somewhere else. I took the opportunity and left. It has been several days since I last saw them and have not heard from them since I snapped. I hope it stays this way but I know they are coming back. Now I tell myself that they did not want a friend, they wanted a punching bag. They saw my boundaries and knowingly tore them down. They always needed me to validate their feelings but never once cared about mine. The friends who left were not bullies, they were protecting themselves.  The problem was always this person.",
