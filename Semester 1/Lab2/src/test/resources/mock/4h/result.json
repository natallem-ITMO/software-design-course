            "selftext": "Hi,\n\nDon't know if I should post this here or not but just wanted to try and see what others think of this situation. \n\nI just wanted to create a post and see if you guys can provide any helpful tips or information on how to proceed with an extremely stressful situation. \n\nTo go back and explain what is happening; basically, my brother's wife immigrated from another country and since the first week of her arrival in our house, she was causing trouble, yelling really loudly for little couple conflicts. They've been married for almost 2 years and didn't spend too much time together and maintained a long-distance relationship. During the long-distance relationship, my bro would contact her every day and talk about random and general stuff. That's when we first started getting hints of something significant that we won't fully understand until much later. Anyways those conversations tend to be around 10-20 mins long and my bro essentially would be doing all the talking or taking interest or asking questions. His wife....just would reply occasionally but her voice would demonstrate a lack of any real interest. Around that time, my bro found a full-time job and would send the majority of his earnings to her just to help her out as well as her family as they were pretty god awful when it came to financial decisions. She would never send even a little gift for him. Anyway, that one-sided conversation would go on for some time occasionally only becoming an actual conversation when it was my bro sending the money and her receiving it (suspicious anyone?). My brother also noticed this and would talk to her about how she seemed to have very little input in these conversations and the only time she showed any interest would be when money was involved. That conversation didn't go too well as his wife flipped her shit and started screaming and yelling and trying to basically avoid the actual issues and personally insult my bro such as how much he makes and how he hasn't been working for that long. Family members would get involved. My bro would talk and try to explain how she is basically neglecting him emotionally and she would always dismiss it by saying \"you feel too much\". \n\nAfter some time, my brother would call again and would basically apologize (she would never apologize or acknowledge the actual issues). This type of situation would occur on and off for the duration of almost 1 and a half year. We all thought that the long distance and the online format was simply causing issues and her coming to Canada and them spending time together would generally fix these issues. \n\nWhen she came to Canada, however, literally on her third day, she would go on to cause one of the biggest family \"scene\" and would be stomping upstairs, downstairs, going outside the house, saying how she wants to go back, would insult my mom and my bro, call him/mock him by saying that he didn't work and didn't want a job, even though he was searching left and right for positions. She essentially would try to get everyone on her side. Why? Why did this conflict start? Well, since she came, she didn't spend any time with her husband and would instead take out her cellphone and watch dumb TikTok videos. She would not engage in any conversation, would give half-assed answers when she was asked to share, would be seen as trying to be as far away from her husband as she can. He noticed and asked her about it and....that led to the huge conflict that ultimately got everyone in my family involved and her crying.\n\nFew months pass by and the situation seems to be improving, along with occasional arguments. One day, my mom was reading posts in a Facebook group and discovered someone posted anon post which felt awfully similar. To top it off, that user gave away their location and the details became more and more familiar as she posted. Everything fit so perfectly. The post itself? The user lying about lots of things such as their marriage and what they do for that marriage. However, the post wasn't about improving marriage or getting advice on how to settle down or make the situation better. It was about simply keeping the PR. Everything revolved around that fact and nothing else. \n\nThat was when we discovered that essentially my bro's wife didn't \"settledown\" and was planning something in the background while appearing to be improving things. She met some women in that group and they give her some advice/told her to \"collect evidence\" and run away. In the post, she implies my bro to be a\"pedo\", calls him crazy, talks about how she is forced to work etc...\n\nI told my bro and showed him the post after some time and he wasn't pleased, and even shocked but just generally depressed about it. He decided to confront her last week which again caused them to have a huge argument. The next day he came home from work and wanted to talk to her and apologize. She didn't take it and once again provoked him. Which caused another argument but only this time, the cops were actually called to our house by someone (don't know whether it was her or her \"friends\") and she puts on an act such  as shaking, mumbling, pretending to vomit, etc... for the sake of the cops. \n\nAnd she admits that the post was, in fact, hers and shows it to the cop. \n\nAnyways she get taken away to a shelter. That entire situation leaves everyone in my family shaken up, depressed and generally confused. The next day? Cops show up and take my bro in custody for questioning because his wife decided to claim that he threaten to hit her or cause bodily harm and domestic violence service gets involved. Now my bro has a criminal record charges and until this thing is solved or if it get resolved, it won't go away which can now destroy my bro's chance to get lots of potential opportunities. \n\nLast week was probably the worst week I can think off for my family in Canada. I legitly feared for the safety of my brother or my parents who felt like they were going to have some serious health problems due to the situation. I felt at one point that they might take their own lives over this matter. It was utterly serious and not something I have ever seen in my family. Cops has never been called to our house ever. And yet they showed up 4-5 times in a single week. We have no idea on how to proceed from here. The last few months weren't that good as we were all mentally tortured by my bro's wife ever since her arrival. And now this shit. To her, none of this matters because ultimately her goal seems to be to use the legal system of Canada and fuck all of us over. According to our source back home, her parents are happy and celebrating that her daughter can now rob us and destroy our family. \n\nAnyone been in a similar situation? Or know of anyone who did? It's a damn shame that if a woman claims anything and pretends to be abused then the system will take her side and treat the other already guilty until proven innocent. My bro's entire life could go down the drain. Her? She has no stakes. If the charges are dropped then she goes free without any legal consequence. And she can always come back with other stuff without anyone questioning her.",

            "selftext": "Alright this one contains like the two previous entries Foot Fetish. Also other sexual themes, like male performing oral on a female etc... It's not shy on busting but it's a little more wholesome in some ways. So I hope you enjoy!  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\n  \nI had just returned home from jogging when I noticed my gorgeous girlfriend Kayla had also returned from work and seemed to be taking a nap on the couch.  \nI slowly and silently approach her, trying not to wake her up and plant a kiss on her cheek. I get no response since she seems to be fast asleep, so I go ahead and tuck her under a thin bedsheet.  \nAfter a brief shower I return to the living room to enjoy a glass of grapejuice (...Alright maybe it was wine) and I can't help but notice her cute milky feet popping out beneath the sheets.  \nThey just look so beautiful I wanna bow don and gently kiss her soles and suck on her toes.  \n\"Well she didn't complain when I kissed her cheek a few minutes ago\" I shrug before leaning down to kiss her feet.  \nBefore I can however she \\*moves\\* beneath the sheets as she starts to wakes up.  \nSitting up she looks at me with sleepy eyes and messy hair and I have to admit she looks more beautiful than ever. Grinning slyly she pulls her foot slightly away from my reach \"Beg first\" She says playfully \"If you really want to kiss my feet that is!\"  \nGiving her a \"Oh really?\" look I decide to play along. \"Please, can I kiss your feet?\"  \n\"Put a bit more passion in it\" She instructs with a mock arrogant tone  \n\"Please, please may I kiss your feet?\"  \nKayla bursts out laughing and moves her foot so that my mouth is right above her ankle. Her toes tracing my chin   \n\"Very well, you may have ONE smooch\"  \nAlmost with an insatiable hunger I plant my lips on her sweaty sole and kiss it as tenderly as I can, savoring its fragrant light aroma.  \nUnable to resist I kiss it over and over again, as a moan escapes Kayla's lips.  \nIt turns into a brief laughter and she lightly kicks me away. \"Come on, I said only one!\"  \nI quickly go in for another kiss before she can pull them away. \"I know, I'm sorry, but I really really like doing it!\" It's evident she enjoys it as well  \nKayla grabs your face and plants a smooch on you right on the lips.  \n\"Yes but now I have to punish you for disobeying me\" She winks at you and kisses you again.  \n\"Maybe that is what I wanted all along?\" I say daringly as I lean in and kiss her a few more times before she stops me amidst giggles. \"Enough, you have had your kisses, its time for you to be punished now!\" Kayla tries to sound menacing but can't completely hide her playfulness.  \nStanding up she goes over to a drawer and grabs something, hides it behind her back and quickly hops back to the couch. I can't help but appreciate the way her sweaty soles slightly stick to the floor and peel off with a satisfying sounds with each step she takes.  \n\"So how will you punish me?\" I asks curious to see what she brought  \n\"With this\" Kayla replies and takes out a blindfold.  \nI like where this is going and I show no resistance as she blindfolds me.  \n\"Now its time to get creative!\"  \nI can't see anything and I am really curious as to what she is going to do. When is she going to strike? From where?   \nI really feel helpless right now but this vulnerability only adds to the intensity of the experience!  \nMy heart starts racing, mostly in excitement but also in fear!  \nI feel Kayla's hot breath around in my ear as her excited voice tingles it.   \n\"If I feel that you're not serving me with all your resolve, you might have to stay like this for a while\" She adds a few more things but I really can't tell what she's saying. Her intoxicating breath along with the smell of her flowery perfume is making me dizzy.  \nI can feel Kayla slowly moving her hands all over my body. She starts from my neck, which she also bites rather hard and moves down to my chest, where she pinches my nipples,  and finally to my crotch, which she gently cups.... for now.  \nSomething is forced in my mouth and the strong sweet taste and texture reveal it to be her used stocking as Kayla gags me with it \"Try not to enjoy this too much\" She says biting my nipples \"It's meant to be a punishment after all\"  \nI nod submissively, after all I have no choice but to follow her orders.  \nMy heart is pounding.  \nI can feel her hot breath on my body.  \nHer hand is slowly, teasingly sliding up my inner thigh.  \nAnd suddenly she strikes, taking hold of my balls.  \nI start to moan into the gag as she squeezes my manhood tight.  \nKayla does not seem to be in the mood for mercy today.   \nShe keeps compressing my vulnerable twin orbs in her tightening grip, as her fingers dig deep into their flesh causing my agony to skyrocket!  \nDespite the ever increasing pain I can't help but feel proud on how much more dominant she has become over the course of the last months.  \nSuddenly she stops squeezing and I can hear her stepping away.   \nHer sweaty feet sticking to the floor with each step she takes.  \nAs my mind is slowly beginning to work again I realize I am dry heaving and my muscles are all stiffened. I don't have enough time to relax completely when I hear Kayla running, each step closer to me.  \nThe gag has slowly fallen off and I can barely see her.   \nWith a running start she kicks her right foot forward and nails me dead on the nuts with her toes.  \nHer momentum and force result in gut-wrenching pain exploding from my nutsack as I struggle to remain standing.   \nGiggling she asks \"So did you learn your lesson?\"  \nI shook my head no and she laughs before repeating her agony inducing move. Again and then once more.  \nEach time I feel like her foot digs deeper into my sack as I yell into the gag.  \nAt her fifth kick in total my  knees give away and I collapse. I can't bear more pain right now.  \nI try to curl up in a ball to shield my fragile bits but she is relentless as she tries to pry her hand between my legs.  \nI push her away playfully and take off the gag.  \n\"Sky\" I mutter out our safeword and her eyes immediately go soft as she starts caressing my hair.  \n\"Are you okay baby?\" She asks to which I groan out what I wanted to be a yes.  \nI can't help but smile as I realize how much her dominant side has emerge.   \nI love everything about Kayla.   \nAnd thought it's true that everything about her gets me hard, it is her unbridled joy that really gets me off. Seeing her enjoy my submissiveness and pain so much fills me with happiness.  \nSeeing her distracted I playfully grab her ankle and bring her foot to my lips.  \n\"A little obsessed are we not\" She laughs as I shrug \"Maybe\" and kiss the sole of her foot.  \n\"That's my boy.\"  \nAfter a few more kisses I let go so I can curl the fetal position. The pain still persists after all.  \nNow it's her that is feeling playful and jumping up, she poses with her foot on my head, and flexes her biceps. \"I'm strong!\"  \n\"Oh yeah?\" I raise an eyebrow and  grab her ankle bringing it close to my lips again.  \n\"I am stronger\" I tease her and grip her ankle tightly.  \n\"Oh really? Are you now?\" She laughs.  \n\"You haven't seen anything yet.\"  \n\"Prove it to me then!\"  \n\"I am stronger because I can...\" I explain bringing her foot closer to your mouth. \"Make you weak by just doing this!\"  \nAnd I take a long slow lick of her sole, starting from the base of her heel and reaching her toes, where I expertly swirl your tongue in between their cervixes.  \nShe moans in pleasure and goes limp as I pleasure her foot with my tongue, enjoying the salt of her sweat in the process.  \n\"Oh shit!\" She gasps \"You are really, really good at that.\"  \nI blush as I stop licking her.  \n\"Is that how you want to be a good boy? And escape further punishment? By doing these perverted things to me?\" She teases  \nI nod and hold her foot close to my chest. \"Anything... Just don't stop doing that.\"  \n\"Don't stop doing what? Stepping on you?\" She giggles  \n\"That too! Don't stop being here for me, and don't stop being amazing. Don't stop dominating me. Don't stop letting me worship you like the goddess you are\"  \nKayla laughs again as she sits back down on my lap, straddling me.  \n\"You're weird.\" She says as she leans forward and kisses me on the lips. \"And I love that you are weird\"  \n\"I know!\" I say as arrogantly as I can \"Of course you do. I am adorable\"  \n\"But to prove you I am strong too...\" She grins devilishly and I know it's coming \"I can easily make you weak too!\" She smashes her knuckles deep and hard on my fragile balls making me moan from pain and pleasure. She does it again and again.  \n\"Alright! Ouch! I got your point! Ahh! You are... Ouch! Strong!\" I raise my hands as if to surrender while she keeps her torture up.  \n\"You like that don't you?\" She giggles as she continues to crush my manhood.  \n\"Ahhhhh! Fuck! Y-You're evil!\" I whine. \"But you are not wrong!\" I hug her tightly and kiss her hard. She moans but she keeps driving her knuckles to my ballsack, while our tongues explore each others mouth.  \nAs I taste her I cant help but give in. To Kayla. And to all of my desires.  \n\"I want to please you. I want you to be happy.\"  I say as I wrap my arms around her back and embrace her closer as I kiss her deeply. All this while her hands don't stop crushing my genitals.  \nI run my hands all over her back and her shoulder blades rubbing them as I enjoy the feeling of her warm, soft skin under my hands.  \n\"Go back to my feet\" She orders and I rush to lower your lips to her heel.  \nKayla places her other foot on my shoulder, slightly pushing me away as she leans back to enjoy the foot worship.  \nI start by kissing her sole tenderly and plan to slowly kiss your way up her foot. My lips talk love and admiration, while my hands reach out for her breasts and begin to play with her tits, in a slightly rougher manner.   \nThis starts out as light teasing, but quickly becomes far more.   \nI can't help but grab them and squeeze them through her shirt while my lips work their magic on her feet.  \n\"Oh yeah, baby. That's it. Work it.\" She moans grinding her sole on my face while I stick my tongue out and lick her sole.  \nMy hands move down her torso while my lips work their way up her toned leg till they both reach her waist.   \nI give her ass a long squeeze while my mouth teases her nether regions. I breath hard on them to stimulate her but keep ignoring them, kissing her thighs all around.  \n\"Oh my God, that feels so good.\" Kayla pants, she seems to be extremely sensitive today. Maybe because of the great foreplay you had.  \nAs I approach my lips to her lower ones I take a quick lick of her clit over her panties, breathing in her wetness.  \nSmiling evilly I tease her pussy with small licks and short kisses, leaving it a bit denied.  \nMaking sure to only spend a second or two on her clit and moving constantly on her thighs aiming to excite her as much as possible.  \n\"You are getting so punished for that.... Ahh... later\" She moans  \n\"Oh shut up! You love it\" I reply and point out how wet she is.  \n\"Your balls are still gonna get it! Aaah!\" She manages to stammer out. \"And you are going to love it as well!\" I smile as she is not wrong and continue this for a few minutes until she had enough.   \nSuddenly she grabs my hair and forcefully pulls my head beneath her legs, trapping my face with my lips right above her pussy.  \n\"Fuck! Stop that and make me cum right now!\" She pants demandingly as her legs wrap around my head, securing me there.   \n\"Do it now or I won't let go Mister!\" She says in a naughty, playful yet slightly menacing way.  \nAnd so I lick away, using all my favorite techniques I know to work on her, on her lips and clit.  \n\"Oh god! I'm gonna come in your mouth if you keep that up!\" She whimpers amidst her moans of pleasure  \nI keep my oral work up on her until she completely loses control and grinds my face in her crotch as hard as she can.  \n\"Didn't you fucking hear me! I'm gonna come in your fucking mouth if you don't stop that!\" She exclaims.  \n\"Please do!\" I whisper and go in for the kill.   \nAnd so she does  \nShe comes hard and long, filling my face and mouth with her feminine juices which I gladly lap up.  \nAs she starts to regain her composure, she pulls my face close her and whispers \"You're still gonna get it later.\" And she kisses me deeply once more  \n\"Still that was an amazing treatment. So expect to be reward it for it too\" She adds after she breaks off the kiss and pats my head tenderly.  \n\"Great...\" I think \"Now I am doubly excited and can't wait to see what she has in mind\"  \n\"Then again my punishments are rewards for you either way\" She laughs and brings her lips to mine again.   \n\"Fuck, you might be a pervert but I really am getting addicted to you a lot.\" She admits with a mock sigh.  \n\"Wouldn't object to a repeat performance either\" I reply and brush my forehead to hers.   \n\"She seems to be turning more perverted than I am!\" I muse with joy \"But I better not mention it now... Better use it to anger her when I want her to punish me.\"",
