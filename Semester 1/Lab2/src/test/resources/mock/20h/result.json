            "selftext": "When it comes to short-term trading (Day and Swing Trading), most people come into it through the method of *Momentum Trading*.  \n\nAs the most *marketable* aspect of short-term trading, many so-called \"gurus\" amass a following, with the intention of selling some product/service, by promising a *get-rich quick* strategy, usually focusing on low-float morning gappers.  \n\nAnd while most professional Day-Traders use momentum trading, it is typically represents only a small portion of the methods they employ on a daily basis.  \n\nFor most, Momentum Trading is just everyone's favorite way to lose money.\n\nIt looks so easy, right?\n\nA low float, heavily shorted stock that nobody has ever heard of until that morning is suddenly jumping on huge volume.\n\nYesterday it was at $4.15, but pre-market it hit $7.20! The bell rings and it opens to $6.10....immediately you see that green bar and it is starting to go! \n\nRocket emojis are flying, people in forums are saying things like, \"Next stop $10!\" and then some weird shit about eating at Wendy's that night.\n\n*But wait* \\- you're not just going to jump right in, no no, not you - you're smarter than that - you will look at some charts first! Maybe you quickly check the daily chart and see a few months ago it hit $22. \n\n*Great, there is room to grow!* \n\n*Damn, there are a lot of bag-holders too!* \n\nGuess which one of those two arguments win out? Room to grow!\n\nNext you continue the process of fooling yourself into believing that this trade is based on rationality by looking at the *price action*. *The 5-min chart?* *The 1-min chart?* Hell - both of them! Let's throw some EMA's on there, and keep an eye on that volume - because now it is all about the....***pullback***.\n\nPerhaps it is the 3-bar method, or the 8-EMA - there are just so many to choose from! For every method there is a video of a someone in a rented Lambo, with around 10 monitors behind them, and *they* are going to show you how they built their amazing fortune.\n\nFinally, you pull trigger - 1,000 shares of Stock **IDGAF** @ $6.34. BAM! Now sure, you only have $7,200 in your account - but with margin taken into account you still have more than half of your buying power left, so you are *Golden, Pony Boy*. \n\nNothing to worry about.\n\nThere is a quick little pop up to $6.66 (yes, intentional), you're up $320 and thinking to yourself, that you are going to shoot for $7.10, right under the pre-market high - I mean, why get greedy right? Or perhaps you are conservative, and decide that .50 cents is nice round number, and make $6.84 the promised land.  You put your offer in and kick back - laughing at all those idiots working 9 to 5 out there.  This is *easy money*!\n\nHowever, it doesn't really matter where that target is, because we all know how this story goes from here, don't we? \n\n**IDGAF** decides to back off a bit and perhaps say hello to its' old friend, VWAP. Damn that was fast. Now it is at $6.03 and you are down $310 - that's a $630 swing - What. The. Hell. Not cool. Not cool at all.  you briefly remember some post somewhere on *risk management*. But this stock is wild, *it can do anything!* No way are you getting out now, only to see a long green candle mock you from your screen.\n\n*Flash forward an hour* \\- **IDGAF** has bounced off VWAP three times and once it almost got close to your breakeven.  Your finger was hovering over the sell button, but you didn't do it - because *it's finally going back up!* Perhaps you can still hit $6.84!  Either way, you put your hard stop right below VWAP. Done.\n\n*Flash forward another hour* \\- Well so much for hard stops huh? You just read that **IDGAF** had really positive results from some trial of some drug that cures some disease, and everyone online is saying it is going to $10, post after post on *Reddit* are saying \"Screw $10 - $100 or nothing!\"  *Diamond Hands! Diamond Hands!* You have now invested way too much time to get knocked out of this trade now.  **IDGAF** is now at $5.95.\n\n*Two Hours later* \\- Remember that extra margin you had? Dollar Cost Averaging Baby! (or that is what you say, because it sounds good - but what really you mean is - averaging down, but \"average down\" sounds bad, so you say *Dollar Cost Averaging -* one day you might even look that up to see what it really means!) The trade is now 1,500 shares now @ $6.19. **IDGAF** is at $5.73 - volume is almost non-existent, until....BAM, huge volume, **IDGAF** is going again! It's at $5.85. It's at $5.97. It's at $6.04. Holy shit - it's coming back!!\n\n*End of the Day* \\- **IDGAF** is at $5.23, and you are down $1,440. You sell. You're depressed. Before you head off to open that bottle, you take a last look at the chart - **IDGAF** is at $8.25 and climbing.\n\nTears begin to fall.\n\nDoes any of this sound familiar?\n\nWhy does it happen?\n\nSure - Risk Management is a problem.  Respecting your stop-loss is another.  But we all know that you can read about those concepts a thousand times, nodding your head and promising yourself the next trade will be different, and yet, it won't be. \n\nThe problem also isn't in technical analysis.  \n\nThe problem is in your head.\n\nTraders have two big mental issues (well, more than that, but for the purposes of this post, there are two) -\n\n1. **We take profits too quickly.** We're always afraid of having our gains taken away from us, so we let fear guide our decisions. And why not? Whenever something good happens in our life it is only a matter of time before the other shoe drops, right? Our natural instinct is to take profits quickly before the market takes it away.  However, this is the opposite of what we *should* be doing.  Instead, we should be *adding* to our winning trades.  There are many reasons to exit a trade (e.g. stock lost Relative Strength to the market, it got rejected at strong resistance, volume dried up, etc.), but fear should never be one of them.\n2. **We hope our losers will turn around.** In many ways, this is an even bigger problem. Because we always think that the moment we sell, the stock will turn around, we stare at the screen, trying to get a reversal through sheer willpower. And why not? We have spent most of our lives hoping things will turn around. You're due. At some point things *have to get better, don't they??* Does a week go by in your life where you don't think, \"*Things have to go my way at some point!\"* And so instead of exiting, we do the opposite, *we double down on our mistake.* We average down when instead we should be looking at the charts without emotion and asking if the reason you got into the trade still applies? Or if you weren't in the trade, would you enter it now given the current conditions? We stay in trades well past the point of rational expectation of a reversal, relying on pure *hope,* the same *hope* we we focus on in our non-trading lives.\n\nThese issues are difficult enough to deal with when you are trading a stock like **MCD** or **AAPL** \\- but when you are trying to scalp **IDGAF**?? Exponentially harder. Why? Because **IDGAF** *can* turn around. **IDGAF** doesn't care about VWAP or EMA's, it is a piece of shit, low float, highly shorted stock that at any moment can suddenly jump from $5 to $8, and so in your mind *there is reason to hope.* Yeah, **MCD** is most likely not going to rebound when **SPY** is dropping and it fell below it's 50 SMA on the daily chart, at least not on that day it won't - but **IDGAF** can - and that *keeps you in the trade.*  You've seen it too many times before with these morning gappers, seemingly dead by mid-day only to come back to life in the last hour. \n\nThis is why I say that momentum trading is the most difficult kind of trading there is, and unfortunately also the most common method used by new traders. Experienced, profitable traders know how to mentally prepare themselves to scalp **IDGAF**, but it takes a long time to get there.\n\nSo if this story resonates with you, please, do yourself a favor and stop . There are so many ways to Day or Swing Trade, and opportunities to make money every day without scalping. \n\nI get it. I get the allure. But the allure has name, it is called gambling. \n\nSo the next time you see an **IDGAF**, pass it by and move on to something you can actually make some money trading.\n\nBest, H.S.",

Basically, a lot of people both under my post and other posts have said that they feel a certain low after shing or like guilty and ashamed of their shing habits. However, I don\u2019t think I have ever felt this kind of guilt. This doesn\u2019t mean I go around showing my wounds/scars to everyone because I don\u2019t find that comfortable to do either. So I do hide my scars but only because I don\u2019t want people around me to needlessly concern themselves over my shing behavior and feel bad or ask me whats wrong or whatever. I simply sh because I want to, because I am in a certain mood, or just because of no reason. Once I have done it, its over and I move on to my other tasks/activities. Basically, I don\u2019t really think its that big of a deal so I hide my wounds because I don\u2019t want other people to make it a big deal upon seeing them. But I don\u2019t think there is any kind of guilt or shame involved for me. \nDoes anyone else agree/feel the same? I also want to know the perspective of people who do feel guilty. Do you perceive sh somewhat different than I do? This is all just out of curiosity so I don\u2019t mean to offend/mock anyone.",
