            "selftext": "**Let's be real:** Celebrity blackmail and casting couches are seldom exciting. Convincing a celebrity, at the height of fame, to strip and to be abused, simply for the chance to star in a film? \n\nWe love to believe this is prevalent in Hollywood, because deep down, both men and women alike, get off to the idea of their favorite celebrity, completely vulnerable and nude.\n\nYour favorite celeb, touching herself for a shady producer? Stripping, or even being fucked? Welll, no. That doesn't happen very often. \n\nYour favorite celeb before she was famous? Well, sure. But that's not very exciting is it? After all, she didn't have a makeup team, or know how to style herself, or do anything to make the idea of her getting pounded, even all that exciting.\n\n**Today, celebs at the height of fame, have recourses, social media, and the ability to speak out against abuse. The solution? Stop wasting times..**\n\n**Celebs come in to interview, and producers and shady directors waste time with niceties, when in actuality, the second her team is paid off and her phone is stolen from her purse - the kindness needs to end.**\n\n**The vocal social justice celebrity? Grind on her the moment she realizes she's locked into an office with a bed, and a man who doesn't care about her plight or her talent.**\n\n**The cute, but not quite hot celebrity? Make her strip, but slowly. Mock her modest body, her wardrobe. Be honest: tell her you enjoy the tears more than her dismal cock sucking performance.**\n\n**Call the curvy celebs fat, mock the skinny ones into shame.**\n\n**Make the married celebs keep their wedding ring on. When they threaten to call their husbands, offer to unlock her phone so you can send him photos of her cum-soaked face.**\n\n**The singer at the height of fame? Make her sing into your cock. Pin her down. The celebs with infamous, fat asses? Your celeb shouldn't leave without a thong full of cum that dripping out of her ass.**\n\n*Those rude, powerful rappers that show up with a whole ass team? Well, they hate her ass, too. Toss them cash, and they'll make sure her ass is bouncing on your cock for hours.*\n\n*The sad, meek celeb, who actually thinks this will help her career? Well, reassure her, only to mock her once the abuse begins.*\n\n**But the best celebs?**\n\n*They're the celebs who have seen it all, and accept it. The smart, savvy female star, who knows her director wants to fuck her brains out, but lets it go more often than not, because when other women come to her claiming abuse, she keeps them quiet, while always ensuring he has more women on set to abuse.*\n\n*She won't give a fuck how cruel men are, and she may even join in.*\n\n**Deep down, celebs are just like everyone else.**\n\n*There should be rough sex, shame, humiliation. Celebs are prettier while being face fucked, with drool dripping down their chins. Her ass is better with cum in it, or cum-coated. Her eyes, better with tears and smeared makeup.*\n\n*She should be shamed for her body, hair, eyes, appearance, etc. No gentleness or kindness. And plenty of misogyny.* \n\n**Kinks:** Choking, Hair, celebs, drugs, race, shame, anal, abuse, facials, blackmail, etc.\n\n18+ for 18+ female partner and characters who are 18+\n\nIn terms of celebs that interest me, I'm open to brainstorming rather than jumping right into the story. This is obviously going to be a darker story idea, and I only want to play it out with the right female partner. I want this to be pretty psychological, rather than just dark smut.\n\nI'll respect your limits, and ask that you respect mine. No photos of characters. Celebs 20+ only.",

            "selftext": "I sat Level II in August 2021. I passed in the 90th percentile. These are some of my thoughts on what worked for me and what didn't. I hope this can help a few of you. This is just one person's experiences.\n\n**What is my background?** \n\n4 years as an engineer in infrastructure financing/leasing. Recently moved to their finance/investment team. I sat Level I in Dec 19. This is my first attempt at Level II. I have no finance background aside from sitting Level I. During the study period, my hours at work were usually 9-5:30pm. \n\n**How many hours did I put in?** \n\nWhile hours alone are quite a misleading indicator, I would estimate 600+. I started in Sep 2020 and planned to give myself 9 months and sit in May 2021. I pushed back to August 2021 to give myself extra time. There were several low quality hours within my total due to lack of focus, or sufficient drive. \n\nI was also very fortunate to have 2 weeks off before the exam (study leave/annual leave). This helped a lot.\n\n**Did I use any 3rd party resource?** \n\nMark Meldrum (MM) together with the CFAI textbooks.\n\n**How did the exam feel?** \n\nGenerall OK, I didn't feel I bombed any area in particular. I know I made a small handful of avoidable mistakes. I had about 30 mins to review on Part A and 45 mins on Part B. It felt much easier than any mocks. Too comfrotable which felt very disconcerting. As a result, I was expecting a high MPS and I was not confident that I would have passed.\n\n**What was my study approach?** \n\nFrom the very beginning, I made a detailed plan that I would refer to and update throughout my study time. This plan covered the deadline by which I would cover each reading/EOC/mock paper. I often would fall behind and have to update the whoel plan, but I generally stuck to it. I added a lot of fat in my plan to account for life, but I had faith in my plan so I stuck to it most of the time.\n\nReadings: I watched MM videos and made annotation in my textbook along the way. \n\nEOCs: I tried my best to do these at the end of each reading. It was quite draining and I would often not finish them all, or not fully understand everything. I had to move on though as there is lots. By exam day, I think I would have looked at 90+% of the EOCs and I knew which ones I kept getting wrong.\n\nLearning Ecosystem: In the last 2-3 months, I used the LE a little bit. I liked that it gave you a score and percentile which motivated me (even though it was in the low 60s). However, I got frustrated with it and only completed about 30% of the questions on there - primarily the EOCs ones that I had already done...!\n\n**How did I score on mocks?** \n\nMM #1 AM (51%) PM (53%)\nMM #2 AM (60%) PM (64%)\nMM #3 AM (62%) PM (60%)\nCFA AM (48%) PM (64%)\n\nI reviewed each one thoroughly.\n\n**When did I start taking mocks?** \n\nI started taking MM mocks 6 -7 weeks before the exam. I sat MM #1 and #2 as 4 separate half mocks as I thought it would be more beneficial to review mistakes before 'wasting' another mock. I took the full CFA mock 1 week before as I thought this would be more representative of the real thing. You can imagine the confidence boost after getting 48% in the AM when I had one week to go! \n\n**Were there any areas I didn't study?** \n\nNot really. I covered the majority of every reading, however I felt quite weak on a few fringe topics on exam day which I'd just not put enough time into. \n\n**Overall advice for someone preparing for Level 2**\n\n- Make a study plan and stick to it. Make sure it's realistic and sustainable. This exam is more a test of resilience than an intelligence test.\n- Properly review all or most of the EOC and BB questions. Any questions you get wrong - mark them and develop an approach so you can return to these. Do the same for mocks.\n- Track your areas of weakness. I used excel to log every EOCs and BB for every reading. I colour coded these so I could return to them and drill the hard topics. On the counter to this - I wasted A LOT of time on excel playing with graphs on my progress etc. so be careful...\n- Pay note to the actual learning objective. Some readings can appear quite convoluted with their notation, examples or explanations. This put me off from properly understanding certain readings until quite late on. In short, remind yourself what the LOSs are, and focus on understanding EOCs and BBs here if you're really stuck. \n- Forums - on topics which I could not make sense of from the books or even MM's videos, I refered to forums on the internet. Would highly recommend.\n- We all know the content is broad. If you have followed a plan, have faith in yourself that it will fall into place. I was truly amazed at my progress under pressure in the final 7 days.\n\nHappy to answer any questions.",

            "selftext": "I am getting CSAI in IIITL in both mock josaa rounds, i listed it as #1 because it is near my home and has great placements. But i read somewhere that it has many bad points like no sports facilities, poor labs and the placements credit goes to IIIT allahabad?\n\nIs this true? Should i change my #1 preference? \n\nThe biggest concern for me is that since now it has it's own campus, will its placements change and will it end up being a bad college? So should i take it if i get it?\n\nI only have till tomorrow to change my preference list. Also someone told me that u/syntaxerror has knowledge in this stuff",

            "selftext": "Warnin gore a bit \n\n2 dreams ago, or 3 days ago, I dreamt about demons jn our world. I had few more dreams about it, just this month. As soon as October started. I kept dreaming about demons and our dying world.\n\nLast night's dream... was an abomination. \n\nI was in our world, that was in the brink of human extinction and extreme famine that cannibalism fastened the exitinction of humans... and children. Only the wealthy Satanists, their slaves and such repulsive demons. Who all wore tuxedos and crowns, were the ones standing in this world. \n\nI was caught by them and was held hostage, so i could be used as a bait for my fellow survivors. I was in an outdoor ball, tied to a pole. Everyone wore fancy shoes, suits and scarves. The grass was so green because in the outside world, nothing was green. There was no women or children in sight but just me... in a crowd of pure evil beings who chatted and laughed like it was just a simple drunken night with the boys. A ball filled with hungry men and demons. All waiting, for their food to arrive. \n\nA woman. A pregnant woman. \n\nIn the middle of everyone being busy chatting and laughing, I tried to cut the rope on my wrists. Only to be slapped by this big demon that was behind me. Then, everyone all turned to look at me. Not a laugh was heard anymore. A man, who was sitting in front of a big throne got up and walked towards me. Only just to mock me, kick me, grab my hair, etc in front of everyone. \n\nAfter all the nonsense, their two young messengers, all boys, told everyone she arrived. The pregnant woman, my friend. \n\nWhen she entered, she looked deformed and not so human at all. \n\nTurns out she was a demon and half human. That was her true appearance. \n\nAnyways dont want to get into the gross part so ill make it quick \n\nShe was used as food, they found their source of food so they ate her gazillion babies that looked like orange caviar and ended her afterwards. \n\n....Then i just woke up. Feeling utterly confused and 'what the fuck did i just see' \n\nYeah... whoever making me dream these things...pls stop \u270b  \n\nAnyways, good morning lol.. time for a cup of coffee",
