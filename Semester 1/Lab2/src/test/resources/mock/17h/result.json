Everytime I think I\u2019m on the other side of you, you reappear. You acknowledge my dreams, only to better mock me at everything you say I will never achieve. You make me afraid of the next time I find myself alone. The excitement I feel around my friends, makes me unrecognizable mere moments after they leave, because I know the only voice LOUDER THAN YOURS is theres!!!! Class clown.. what a strange name to be called.. I can make everyone else laugh, but I can\u2019t even afford myself a smile.\nFuck you depression.. I would kill you if I could. You tortuous wretch. Dementor. You suck the color out of life, and hope out of the future. You are not a part of me. You\u2019re a parasite who found me, and I wish you gone from my life and my mind!!!!!

            "selftext": "Hey there,  \nIm a new FastAPI developer, and I want to get around to testing the endpoints for the simple API I've created. The API basically has endpoints to search for, register and login users, and the Database connection is through MongoEngine.  \n\n\nThe Sample API for user retrieval through email address looks like this:\n\n    @user.get('/users',\n              response_model=User,\n              responses={404: {\"model\": Message}},\n              tags=[\"user\"])\n    async def find_user(email: str = Query(None)):\n        checkUserExists = MongoUser.objects(email=email)\n        if checkUserExists:\n            query_user = MongoUser.objects(email=email)[0]\n            response_object = {\n                'id': str(query_user.id),\n                'email': query_user.email,\n                'password': query_user.password,\n            }\n    \n            return response_object\n    \n        else:\n            return JSONResponse(\n                status_code=404,\n                content={\"message\": \"User not found\"}\n            )\n\nWhere user model and the mongo document of the Users looks like this:  \n\n\n    class User(BaseModel):\n        id: typing.Any\n        email: str\n        password: constr(min_length=4)\n    \n    \n    class MongoUser(Document):\n        email = EmailField(required=True, unique=True)\n        password = StringField(required=True, min_length=8)\n\n  \nHow do I go about writing the Pytest for this? I followed the official documentation and was able to write the tests accordingly. However, I dont want my tests to connect to the database.  I want it to mock the db and run the tests accordingly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    from fastapi.testclient import TestClient\n    from app import app\n    from tests.testdata import create_data\n    \n    client = TestClient(app)\n    \n    \n    def test_get_user_email_success():\n        response = client.get(\"/users?email=example%40gmail.com\")\n        assert response.status_code == 200\n        response_body = response.json()\n        assert response_body[\"email\"] == \"example@gmail.com\"\n\nThis returns a pass, but like I said, I dont want my tests to connect to the database. I've seen the recommendation of using \"mongo-mock\" module for this, but does anyone have like a detailed guide or experience using it? Because Im really new and im rather lost to be honest.",

Just trying to recoup as much of my cost as I can. \n\nParts are as follows:\n\nNDS A1 upper: brand new, has two little nicks from handling. Has M4 feed ramps. Catch and release off GAFS: $150\n\nBCM MCMR 7: brand new, will come with all the stuff BCM sends with their rails (QD, wrench, etc) $150\n\nBA 14.5 carbine barrel: brand new. $115\n\nBCM A2X extended bird cage. Brand new. $20\n\nLBE carbine has tube. $10\n\nTV: $445\n\nEverything is brand new and only removed from packaging for pics/mock up. \n\nPrices are shipped, PP G/S, you pay fees. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/p5yphB1",

            "selftext": "A number of Socialists have latterly launched a regular crusade against what they call the principle of authority. It suffices to tell them that this or that act is authoritarian for it to be condemned. This summary mode of procedure is being abused to such an extent that it has become necessary to look into the matter somewhat more closely.\n\nAuthority, in the sense in which the word is used here, means: the imposition of the will of another upon ours; on the other hand, authority presupposes subordination. Now, since these two words sound bad, and the relationship which they represent is disagreeable to the subordinated party, the question is to ascertain whether there is any way of dispensing with it, whether \u2014 given the conditions of present-day society \u2014 we could not create another social system, in which this authority would be given no scope any longer, and would consequently have to disappear.\n\nOn examining the economic, industrial and agricultural conditions which form the basis of present-day bourgeois society, we find that they tend more and more to replace isolated action by combined action of individuals. Modern industry, with its big factories and mills, where hundreds of workers supervise complicated machines driven by steam, has superseded the small workshops of the separate producers; the carriages and wagons of the highways have become substituted by railway trains, just as the small schooners and sailing feluccas have been by steam-boats. Even agriculture falls increasingly under the dominion of the machine and of steam, which slowly but relentlessly put in the place of the small proprietors big capitalists, who with the aid of hired workers cultivate vast stretches of land.\n\nEverywhere combined action, the complication of processes dependent upon each other, displaces independent action by individuals. But whoever mentions combined action speaks of organisation; now, is it possible to have organisation without authority?\n\nSupposing a social revolution dethroned the capitalists, who now exercise their authority over the production and circulation of wealth. Supposing, to adopt entirely the point of view of the anti-authoritarians, that the land and the instruments of labour had become the collective property of the workers who use them. Will authority have disappeared, or will it only have changed its form? Let us see.\n\nLet us take by way of example a cotton spinning mill. The cotton must pass through at least six successive operations before it is reduced to the state of thread, and these operations take place for the most part in different rooms. Furthermore, keeping the machines going requires an engineer to look after the steam engine, mechanics to make the current repairs, and many other labourers whose business it is to transfer the products from one room to another, and so forth. All these workers, men, women and children, are obliged to begin and finish their work at the hours fixed by the authority of the steam, which cares nothing for individual autonomy. The workers must, therefore, first come to an understanding on the hours of work; and these hours, once they are fixed, must be observed by all, without any exception. Thereafter particular questions arise in each room and at every moment concerning the mode of production, distribution of material, etc., which must be settled by decision of a delegate placed at the head of each branch of labour or, if possible, by a majority vote, the will of the single individual will always have to subordinate itself, which means that questions are settled in an authoritarian way. The automatic machinery of the big factory is much more despotic than the small capitalists who employ workers ever have been. At least with regard to the hours of work one may write upon the portals of these factories: Lasciate ogni autonomia, voi che entrate! \\[Leave, ye that enter in, all autonomy behind!\\]\n\nIf man, by dint of his knowledge and inventive genius, has subdued the forces of nature, the latter avenge themselves upon him by subjecting him, in so far as he employs them, to a veritable despotism independent of all social organisation. Wanting to abolish authority in large-scale industry is tantamount to wanting to abolish industry itself, to destroy the power loom in order to return to the spinning wheel.\n\nLet us take another example \u2014 the railway. Here too the co-operation of an infinite number of individuals is absolutely necessary, and this co-operation must be practised during precisely fixed hours so that no accidents may happen. Here, too, the first condition of the job is a dominant will that settles all subordinate questions, whether this will is represented by a single delegate or a committee charged with the execution of the resolutions of the majority of persona interested. In either case there is a very pronounced authority. Moreover, what would happen to the first train dispatched if the authority of the railway employees over the Hon. passengers were abolished?\n\nBut the necessity of authority, and of imperious authority at that, will nowhere be found more evident than on board a ship on the high seas. There, in time of danger, the lives of all depend on the instantaneous and absolute obedience of all to the will of one.\n\nWhen I submitted arguments like these to the most rabid anti-authoritarians, the only answer they were able to give me was the following: Yes, that's true, but there it is not the case of authority which we confer on our delegates, but of a commission entrusted! These gentlemen think that when they have changed the names of things they have changed the things themselves. This is how these profound thinkers mock at the whole world.\n\nWe have thus seen that, on the one hand, a certain authority, no matter how delegated, and, on the other hand, a certain subordination, are things which, independently of all social organisation, are imposed upon us together with the material conditions under which we produce and make products circulate.\n\nWe have seen, besides, that the material conditions of production and circulation inevitably develop with large-scale industry and large-scale agriculture, and increasingly tend to enlarge the scope of this authority. Hence it is absurd to speak of the principle of authority as being absolutely evil, and of the principle of autonomy as being absolutely good. Authority and autonomy are relative things whose spheres vary with the various phases of the development of society. If the autonomists confined themselves to saying that the social organisation of the future would restrict authority solely to the limits within which the conditions of production render it inevitable, we could understand each other; but they are blind to all facts that make the thing necessary and they passionately fight the world.\n\nWhy do the anti-authoritarians not confine themselves to crying out against political authority, the state? All Socialists are agreed that the political state, and with it political authority, will disappear as a result of the coming social revolution, that is, that public functions will lose their political character and will be transformed into the simple administrative functions of watching over the true interests of society. But the anti-authoritarians demand that the political state be abolished at one stroke, even before the social conditions that gave birth to it have been destroyed. They demand that the first act of the social revolution shall be the abolition of authority. Have these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? Should we not, on the contrary, reproach it for not having used it freely enough?\n\nTherefore, either one of two things: either the anti-authoritarians don't know what they're talking about, in which case they are creating nothing but confusion; or they do know, and in that case they are betraying the movement of the proletariat. In either case they serve the reaction.",

            "selftext": "I was using a friend's thc vape pen for the first time while alone with my then bf. I got too high from one hit because I didn't realize how strong it was. I told my bf I was too high and I was really uncomfortable and scared. He started to mock me and mess with me. He grabbed me once and I started hyperventilating, then he grabbed me again and I had a full on panic attack. While I was panicking he turned over in bed. Once I got ahold of myself I apologized that he had to see that and said I should have been more careful with the pen. I asked if he was upset and he said yes. I asked why and he said it was because he acted the way he did because he had never been around someone having a panic attack before and didn't know what to do, and was afraid I would leave him because of that. I was still really uncomfortable and had another panic attack.\n\nThe next day I told him I felt like I couldn't depend on him when I was having an emergency and he said it wasn't an emergency and if it was he would have taken me to a hospital. So I said well if I ever have another panic attack next time could I have a friend to come over and comfort me. He said ok.\n\nI really wanted to break up with him because I thought it was so weird how the health of the relationship was a priority when I was having multiple panic attacks, but a friend convinced me to stay. I stayed for a couple more weeks but I couldn't forget how my trust was broken. He treated me really well during those couple of weeks and spent a lot of money on gifts for me and bought my friends food. Eventually I was so uncomfortable I just couldn't take anymore and broke up even though we were really compatible. I didn't say it was because of the panic attack but right after we broke up he called my best friend and said he thought that was why and seemed to resent me for it bc he felt like that was a mistake and he had apologized.\n\nSo that's the story what do you guys think? Was he just being immature and didn't know about panic attacks? Or was this a red flag for a bigger issue?\n\nHe still messages my best friend and seems to want to get back together",
