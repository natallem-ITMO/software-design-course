            "selftext": "I, like many of you, watched the Oregon game yesterday with Thibodeaux being absolutely ridiculous. He reminds me a huge amount of Vonn Miller and is clearly a freak. Having spent most of the day before this, trading down on TDNs mock draft simulator in order to grab Malik Willis, I found this very difficult.\n\n\n\nI'm a strong believer in picking a QB high in the draft if you want one or not at all. Mathbomb on twitter posted a great thread why: https://twitter.com/MathBomb/status/1451886385514831873?t=eyufnkNS0TFGgC6e4Tf_kw&amp;s=19\n\n\n\nI also don't think it's wise to just wait till next year for a QB. We need a new QB this draft. Main reason for this is the culture change. We all agree Goff has been terrible but it's more than that. His temperment just doesn't mesh with the direction of the team. Campbell wants grit, toughness and a leader. Goff appears mild mannered quiet and out of place on the sideline. Blough is the one pacing up and down encouraging teamates (Blough is also not the answer obviously). More Goff next year is not a neutral position, it is actively harmful on the rest of the team. The defence started out very well against the Bengals but they gave up 2nd half, likely partially due to tiredness but also because they lost all faith in the O doing anything. There was nothing for the team to get excited about. His play and manner sucks energy from the team. 30 mill cap hit or not he can't start next year. We need a QB.\n\n\n\nHowever we need a pass rusher badly, and most analysts accept that key must-haves for good teams are: elite QB, elite OT, elite WR, elite pass rusher, elite CB. Kayvon Thibodeaux looks elite and we haven't had an elite edge rusher in forever (unless you count occasional games from Ziggy which I don't). He is perfect for the scheme as well showing some ability to occasionally drop in coverage which Glenn has Flowers do on occasions.\n\n\n\nQuite the conundrum. Now we know that Brad Holmes is from a front office which is not afraid of a trade. Also we know Brad Holmes is pretty trigger happy given the trade for Barnes and the almost trade for Onwuzurike. I don't think he would be afraid to pull the trigger to trade up for a QB (as the Rams did for Goff). The team we would need to jump (atm pending Tua talk) is Washington who are currently pegged to pick 8th. The Falcons are 7th. Trading the 29th pick, 3rd rounder and our 1st from next year would get us to 7th and allow us to take Malik Willis after taking Thibodeaux. Clearly this is a lot to give up, especially as our pick next year will be a high one more than likely. But it is a big statement of intent and sets the franchise up for the long term. Keeps our 2nd round pick as well which could be spent on a WR or S or LB depending on best available.\n\n\n\nTLDR Thibodeaux amazing. Goff bad and damaging long term so QB big need. Trade up so can have both",

Does that mean Christianity as a religion encourage that? Absolutely not!\n\nA few years back, some of our own Muslims were calling the Myanmar junta as \"Buddhist terrorists\". I called them out and reminded them about the implications of gross generalisation. People on the Internet laugh at how some Hindus drink cow urine. I told them not to mock Hinduism. Any misrepresentation I remind people that this is not necessarily true; furthermore, we don't even know the actual religion so how can we comment about that stuff?\n\nIn short - stop generalising and first ACTUALLY educate yourself. Those commentators will criticise untrue fscts about Islam but start sweating if we ask them what the integrals of prayer are or what the essence of tawheed is. Not only do you look stupid and ignorant - you're contributing to a culture of hate, not free speech. There's a difference between the two.",
