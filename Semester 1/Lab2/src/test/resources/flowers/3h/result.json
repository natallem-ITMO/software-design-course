The issue is, whenever i look online for ideas, i find almost all of them are flowers or quotes, and that really just isn't my style, I've been thinking maybe a lighthouse or something related to the east coast of Canada, but i really don't know. I just don't want anything super basic like flowers or quotes. Does anyone have any suggestions or maybe they've seen some really nice forearm cover ups?",

            "selftext": "Recently, I've been making a list of events throughout my childhood and adult life as I remember them. They're not in order - and honestly, trying to get them from oldest to newest feels like too much of a drain. Right now I've been trying to get a list of all the good things but for some reason I'm unable to find more than a handful. Is it normal to draw a blank when you attempt a list of positives on a JNM? Some of these may be triggering and if they are, my apologies. This is mostly for myself in case anything happens to my laptop and the info is lost, but feel free to read and relate or give your thoughts.\n\n* How hurt she was that FH (Future Husband) asked my dad\u2019s permission first for my hand in marriage. She took it really personally. My parents had been divorced for a very long time.\n* She flirted with FH (then BF) when it became obvious that we were very serious about each other. Overly friendly. Latching on to his arm like a koala. Being visibly happier to see him than me. It got slightly worse when she realized he was better off financially than any of my past bf\u2019s, though I might be reading too much into this.\n* When I felt the need to thank her for being a SAHM during our young childhood years, after I saw how parents around me struggle with guilt on having to leave their kids with other adults because both had to work.\n* As a child, I was a bit boisterous: climbing trees, hated shoes, hated dresses. Often I would stub my toes so hard the nail would be loose so. Blood. Her primary concern was the mess I\u2019d leave on the floor where I walked. Eventually I would hide a burst toe or loose toenail just so she wouldn\u2019t freak out.\n* She wanted to walk my younger sister down the isle instead of my dad, but I understand my sister didn\u2019t really want to have my dad walk her down the isle either. Luckily they did reach a compromise.\n* There was no way to have a straight conversation about personal problems I had. Even the ones that didn\u2019t involve her. Somehow those personal problems would be turned into her inadequacy as a mother.\n* Very rarely could I talk openly with her where she wouldn\u2019t burst into tears or get angry. Initiating a personal conversation had to start, continue and end with how loved +appreciated + valued she is, while sneaking in whatever was bugging me in between the roses. \n* How sh\\*t scared we were as teenagers when it was time for her to come home, because we didn\u2019t know what mood she\u2019d be in. We did our chores out of fear and had a clean house, clean laundry, and a hot cup of coffee ready when she walked in the door. Some nights we wouldn\u2019t speak more than 5 words just in case we annoyed her too much. I remember a particularly bad two week streak. SO much so I secretly ordered flowers to be delivered at her work and wrote a message in my own handwriting but without a name. Just to make it end. She knew from the handwriting that it was from me, but fueled office gossip by hinting the (two dozen) red roses came from a man. She did send me a message acknowledging and thanking me. It worked. She was happy and cheerful for a long time after that.\n* I couldn\u2019t just offload. I couldn\u2019t vent without there always being a ready-made list of things I should do/how I should handle the situation.\n* As soon as a past relationship with a partner passed the honeymoon phase, her first response was \u201cGet out of there and stay with me for a while, I\u2019ll even come fetch you\u201d. I get that mothers would do anything for their children but, Idk, her eagerness to bring her adult daughter home every time the road got a little rocky just.. Urgh.. And also not all these relationships were bad btw, and none of them were dangerous.\n* When she had to apologize; she\u2019d apologize for not keeping her mouth shut, for not being good enough, that I misunderstood what she meant, or the best one: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for breathing.\u201d\n* She got custody of us as kids after the divorce and left the country with us without my dad\u2019s permission. She sold the house he\u2019d bought for us to live in and put it all in her bank without my dad\u2019s knowledge. So he stopped paying child support for the amount she\u2019d gained from the sale.. She then told us we have to go live with him because he isn\u2019t paying CS and \u201cshe can\u2019t afford us anymore\u201d. We were teenagers. My dad didn\u2019t fight for us because, admittedly, he became a shell of the man he used to be during their marriage. \n* Don\u2019t know if this counts but. The same day I got approval on a student loan (in my name, that I had to pay back, Malignant would only be paying the monthly fees till I found a job) was the same day she took out life assurance on me. She said she wouldn\u2019t be responsible for the loan if anything happened to me. \n* The gaslighting.\n* Recently she asked if I could take over the monthly life assurance payments and I said sure no problem, but then changed her mind when I mentioned wanting to put FH on the beneficiary list since he offered to take up the payments (I was unemployed at the time and couldn\u2019t have made those payments). She is still sole beneficiary and that policy is well over US$45k by now.\n* I couldn\u2019t speak fondly of my dad \u2013 or even stand up for him without having her or my aunt (her sister) jump down my throat for \u201chow I\u2019d attacked her by defending him\u201d.\n* As an adult, 80% of the time when I announced that I had good/exciting/big news, her go-to outburst would be a serious \u201cJust don\u2019t say you\u2019re pregnant\u201d or similar.\n* When it came to light that I was financially helping a friend. Long story short, her family is in my home country (country1) but she is in the same country as me (country2). It\u2019s so much easier to have her family send money to my country1 savings bank account and I (with FH) give her the equivalent in country2\u2019s currency in hand. She can\u2019t have a bank account on her name. Malignant\u2019s only concern was \u201cbut who is paying the bank fees?\u201d\n* The regular \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with your skin\u201d during video calls. I have adult acne. It isn\u2019t bad \u2013 I mean, besides blackheads I have more white heads than the majority of the women I see and yeah, I pick at them. But I wouldn\u2019t consider my face ghastly. I can count on one hand the times my dad raised concerns, but I never felt personally attacked by his approaches.\n* That she can be direct and up front with me, but it isn\u2019t well received the other way around. Which means I speak with her as little as possible.\n* After promising to build her a dream retirement house, at no building cost to her, we had great communication. Voice and video calls multiple times a week. Laughter and jokes and generally just feel good vibes. Then she did what she did to FH. I think it\u2019s because she no longer knows where she stands with him that everything went downhill.\n* I gave up netball at the age of 8. I got the ball into the hoop for the very first time, I was so proud of myself. But when I looked around to see if my mother saw my accomplishment, she wasn\u2019t there. It wasn\u2019t the first time she was absent, but it was the first time I made the shot. It felt horrible, I didn\u2019t want to feel like that again. So I stopped doing sports all together.\n* The rare attempts to set a boundary, the most recent one sorting my own transport instead of having her or family driving me around when I went for a visit (to sort paperwork, else I\u2019d never have gone), her response was \u201cDon\u2019t be full of sh\\*t now\u201d. The younger sister I was going to stay with agreed with her. When I told Malignant that was uncalled for, same sister went wtf. Malignant admitted it was out of line and it never came up again. I still don't know if she was referring to her remark or my reaction.\n* The \u201cBeat first ask questions later\u201d approach as kids whenever something broke or one of us cried. But I don't recall her using this tactic in public.\n* Hovering over me when I cooked us a meal, though I can\u2019t remember if she did the same with my sister. This is why I avoided cooking as much as possible. \n* Exposing us to her brother whom, unknown to us at the time, had abused two out of three of his daughters and physically assaulted his own wife so bad she was almost paralyzed. Malignant had her suspicions but kept quiet. \n* All the past times I\u2019ve tried either LC or NC, she would initiate drama to lure me back into communicating with her, for example apologizing for being such a horrible mother and only doing the best she could, but she hopes I\u2019m doing well wherever I am (she knew where I was).\n* My dad kept all our finger paintings \u2013 the ones he managed to save from Malignant. She said it\u2019s clutter. There isn\u2019t one picture that I know of that she\u2019s kept, besides the personalized bday cards where kids adore their mothers.\n* As a teenager, I learned that walking away from her during an argument would only result in her running after me to my room and keeping me from closing the door, regardless if I asked for a time out. Because she wouldn\u2019t stop until I gave up.\n\nThere were some good times too, though. We never starved, we stayed clothed. I do remember a lot of hugs. \n\nI remember her and dad taking turns with each of us getting into our beds till we fell asleep almost every night. One night she\u2019d be with me, the next night was dad and so on. It slowed down when I turned 8 or 9 I think.\n\nShe made sure we had lunches to take to school and very rarely had junk food.\n\nWe could do extracurricular activities at school as long as it was free. She didn\u2019t trust whoever was picking us up on a night out unless she met the person face to face. \n\nShe often says how proud she is of all three of her daughters, that she loves all of us.",

            "selftext": "I am on probation for pleading guilty to conspiracy. Part of the terms of my probation is to not have any contact with my daughters dad unless it\u2019s about visiting my daughter. He is on felony probation but mine was a misdemeanor. He was charged with importing into state and I plead guilty to a misdemeanor \n\nHe came to CO to live with me and \n 8 weeks into his probation he strangled me and I called the police. They came and took him away and there was a no contact order placed against me and my daughter. So I was good for a few months. Until on my birthday he sent me flowers and we decided to reconcile and move in together. Things have been rocky as our daughter is pretty young and we were both adjusting to being new parents. She is 1. He asked me to write a letter to the judge stating that I fabricated the whole thing (this I have proof of in my text messages where he is coaching me on what to say) so I did in order to help his case because he guilted me saying that he was going to jail and couldn\u2019t be there to provide. Since then things have been so so at best. Friday night he came back into town because he is traveling for work even though his probation forbids it he only comes back into town when he has to drop a UA. we got into another physical altercation where I told him I was gonna call the police again because he left extensive visible bruising. He stole my phone and kept me in the house so I wouldn\u2019t leave. I was yelling at my neighbors but they didn\u2019t hear me. After a few hours my mom came to get me and I\u2019ve been at her house ever since. He has a lot of money and got a really good attorney to deal with his DV charges but I don\u2019t know what to do I feel stuck. He hasn\u2019t answered to his POV because the state is waiting to see how his charges play out he is taking his case to trial to get them dismissed. I am financial dependent on this person now I have no place to live with my infant he keeps telling me to come back but I honestly don\u2019t want to I just idk. My daughter wants to go home and I feel extremely stuck. He is financially abusive as fuck he makes me ask for anything and everything. I don\u2019t even know what I am asking for.",

According to the selected game the scenarios that will take place are mentioned in the tables below.\n\n  \n\n|**Game**|**How to play**|**Win**|**Loss**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Rock, Paper, Scissors|The DM and player play an actual game of Rock, paper and scissors|One enemy of yours at random forgets your name and physical   description (Not for future interactions).|One mortals who is aware of you now hates you.|\n|Hot Potato|The Dm selects a random playlist and all people on the table   (including DM) pass around an item around them until the song ends.

He is a stickler for rules, cheating is highly punishable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Magician\n\nA neon red haired man wearing a purple cape holding a wand by both hands in front of their chest pointed towards the sky. He wears pointy and curved boots. If one slowly turns the card to the side slightly they would see a skull superimposed over their head.\n\nWhen the card is drawn a thick green mist spreads around the bearer while the card itself melts in an oozy green liquid that sizzles, the mist coalesces into the wizard of the card. Who levitates from the ground asking what the person who drew the card wants him to create. The Wizard will offer the choice of casting any spell or create any potion requested by the card holder whether it exists in reality or not. Within a brief second and the flick of the wizard\u2019s wrist the spell is cast or the potion is made and handed over. It is to be noted whatever was requested the exact opposite will be received. If the card holder or any person watching the scene makes an active perception check or insight they will find something off with the wizard, at certain angles the head transforms into a skull for a brief period.\n\n*\u201cOne must be sure both consciously and unconsciously of what they are seeing is true reality\u201d*\n\n**Roleplaying the Magician:** The Magician isn\u2019t evil on his own but is trying to send the message that not everyone can be trusted just because they are attempting to aid you. He is charismatic and has a silver tongue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The High Priestess\n\n*A dark skinned woman dressed in pale blue dress that covers from neck to toe tied loosely at her waist with a golden tasseled rope. Her sleeves widen from the elbow. She wears pale gloves to protect her hands which are clasped before her on her lap. A pale wimple over which draped is a white veil is crowned by a golden wreath on her head. She sits solemnly on a marble stool with her eyes closed.*\n\nThe card when drawn turns into pomegranate seeds which multiply over and over again until they form a puddle from which emerges the high priestess untouched by any of the juices or dirt from where she emerges. She steps on air never truly putting her feet on the ground. Upon reaching the bearer she puts forward her hands palm up, allowing the bearer to place their own on top of hers. She psychically gleans the bearer\u2019s thoughts. She announces that she is here to provide enlightenment and to aid in the knowing of the self. She allows the bearer to unload their turmoil and conflicts upon her, allowing a channel to catharsis. She will solve two conflicts that require external input and one conflict that requires looking into oneself.\n\n**Roleplaying the High Priestess:** She is understanding and wise. She remains calm in a manner that can be described as someone who has seen all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Empress\n\n*A blue haired and teal eyed woman dressed in a pink gown with her right hand leaning on a roman pillar while holding a golden cup in her left. A platinum circlet crown upon her head with spire like design lays on her head. She wears a purple overcoat.*\n\nThe car when drawn burst into cherry blossoms that swirl around the bearer before forming a cyclone of petals of various flowers. The petals coalesce to form the Empress in all her glory leaning similarly to her card depiction. She conjures a throne and a sofa facing each other beckoning the bearer to take a seat on the sofa. She conjures a bottle of wine and two goblets. She will strike a conversation with the bearer trying to glean how in tune with their feminine side the bearer is. As the conversation continues she will keep pouring wine into the glass trying to get the bearer drunk (this wine cannot be immunized even with Dwarven resilience). By the time she is done the bearer will pass out from being too drunk.\n\nIf the Empress finds the bearer to be feminine enough she places a goblet on the unconscious body. This goblet can be used to create a greater restoration potion. This potion must be drunk directly from the goblet and cannot be transferred from the goblet in any other form. The goblet requires attunement and if the item is passed on to another person it turns to dust which is permanent. The Goblet can be called forth by a passphrase no matter the distance or plane.\n\nIf the Empress doesn\u2019t feel the bearer to be feminine enough she will cause the unconscious bearer\u2019s form will shift until they change genders and become female. This transformation is permanent (a wish spell can reverse it). If the bearer already female in gender the empress will instill in her the bond/ideal to become more feminine.\n\n*\u201cWomen rule the world\u201d*\n\n**Roleplaying the Empress:** The Empress is confident and completely comfortable in her skin. She is adamant about how women are better rulers than the men who sit on majority of the thrones. She provides examples of deities like the Mourning Matron, The Leviathan, The Mistress of the Hunt, The Weaving Maligner and several similar women. She even spouts examples of women whose downfall was due to following men, like Faridinah the Lich. The qualities she is looking for in the bearer is elegance, sensuality, fertility, creative expression, and nurturing abilities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Emperor\n\n*An orange curly haired rotund emperor dressed in red tunic having an imperial beard. He wears sabatons on his feet which have tapered points. He wears a platinum circlet crown with a central spire.*\n\nThe card after being drawn disappears leading to the sounds of herald trumpets being played. The clinking of armor is heard before the Emperor arrives in a shower of roses. The Emperor brings forth his ringed hand forward allowing the bearer to kiss his royal ring. If the bearer doesn\u2019t understand the gesture he berates them on the importance of manners and how to hold themselves in polite society. He will strike a conversation with the bearer trying to glean how in tune with their masculine side the bearer is. As the conversation continues he will nod, making comments on places where the bearer must make changes. Once the conversation has lead the emperor to make an apt judgement on the masculinity of the bearer he abruptly ends the conversation and ask the bearer to kneel before him. He conjures a bejeweled sword and proceeds to ritualistically touch both shoulders with the tip of the blade similar to a knighting ritual. Once the ritual is complete the bearer\u2019s form will feel a shift according to the judgement of the emperor.\n\nIf the emperor believes to be masculine enough he grants them the blade. The blade has an enchantment of a +3, with an additional 2d8 radiant damage on a hit (this blade can also act as a spellcasting focus and will deal the additional damage when spells are cast using the blade). The blade will return to the owner no matter the distance or plane when the activation phrase is spoken. The blade does require attunement but if the blade is passed on to a different person it turns to dust which is permanent.\n\nIf the Emperor believes the bearer is not masculine enough he will punish them with a coming of age ceremony of a tribal or similar community. Often times this will be slaying of an animal with bare hands or surviving in a harsh landscape with nothing more than the most basic tools.\n\n*\u201cMen are the rock that hold everything together\u201d*\n\n**Roleplaying the Emperor:** The Emperor is confident, has a slight ego, and is a just person. He is adamant about how men must be the foundation that holds society and family upright. They believe takes several roles in their life which always better society. They quote famous men of history and have a slightly low opinion of women. The qualities he is looking for in the bearer is the fact if they provide and protect their family and allies in every way they can. They also look for the stability and financial security of the bearer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Hierophant\n\n*An elderly blonde haired monk with a fringe in the front and long shoulder length hair. He is wearing blue robes with a purple cloak, purple sash around their waist. They lean forward on a golden staff that has three parallel rods protruding horizontally from it each of decreasing length from above (similar to a papal cross).*\n\nUpon the drawing of this card the hymns of a choir calm their way into the ears of all those near the bearer. The Hierophant of the card emerges from the card blessing the bearer of the card. After blessing the Hierophant opens his arms to questions that need to be divined. The bearer may ask three question whose answers no matter how hidden will be divined by the priest. The questions cannot be delayed, but they can be transferred to another person other than the bearer.\n\n*\u201cThe word was here before you and will remain even after you have left, the word is eternal. It is the question and it is the answer.\u201d*\n\n**Roleplaying the Hierophant:** The hierophant is a clamed person of faith who believes in the ancient beings rather than the new upstarts who have taken their rightful place. He doesn\u2019t anger and hates blasphemy. He will ignore questions that would make a person a deity, lead to the harm or death of a deity, reduce the power of a deity, etc. If the bearer is an atheist, the hierophant will not arrive. The hierophant doesn\u2019t discriminate on the deity, demon, devil, etc. worshipped by the bearer as long they are a divine being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Lovers\n\n*A hand squeezing a beating heart.*\n\nThe card pulses like a heart before getting warn with each beat and finally being too to hold. Once drop the card turns into a cherub that holds a heart in their hand. The cherub then points to the ground where materializes the unconscious body of the most loved being of the bearer missing their heart. The Cherub asks the bearer them to come clean with them for it to return the heart to the bearer\u2019s loved being. Coming clean requires the bearer to air out all the secrets it has kept from that being. If the bearer doesn\u2019t comply or tries to harm the cherub it will harm the being instead. The Cherub allows three tries before it truly dishes out a punishment. If the bearer fails this task the cherub will squeeze the heart leading the bearer\u2019s loved one to die.\n\n**Roleplaying the Card:** The Cherub will materialize only one loved being, which can range from parents, siblings, significant other, friend or close ally. Coming clean requires the bearer to speak the truth, any attempt at deception will be an automatic fail. The deception rolls are allowed but it mustn\u2019t be revealed that the cherub can see through them. Creatures killed by this card can be resurrected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Chariot\n\n*A two wheeled Egyptian open chariot decorated with the sun, the moon and stars.*\n\nUpon being pulled the sounds of a wooden wheel rolling on a rough gravelly road can be heard, suddenly from the nearest largest shadow emerges a chariot being pulled by two dark unicorns whose coats seem like the night sky with the stars sparkling on them. Standing on the chariot is an olive skinned woman wearing what can be best described as an amalgamation of a warrior and aristocratic Egyptian garb and jewelry. The woman stands with confidence emanating an aura of someone who knows what they want and will grab it by the reigns. The woman disembarks from the chariot and greets all who are present and presents the solution to their problem (she will ask this in a way with emphasis on asking the bearer what they want). The bearer will receive the path that is easiest to achieve what they have requested with each step explained, she will only say the answer once before disappearing in the shadows. \n\nThis card requires the card bearer to be sure of what they want, and to be focused on it, it must be something they want themselves and not something they asked on the behalf of someone else. If the request is a spur of the moment or discussed with others the woman will reject the bearer and leave into the shadows (she will allow three tries of asking question before she leaves).\n\n*\u201cThe chariot awaits for those who have a sense of direction. The wheels of life get damaged by those who take the chariot through the roughness of the wild. So choose a path and ride into the sunset.\u201d*\n\n**Roleplaying the Rider:** The Rider is confident and direct. She doesn\u2019t like delays nor does she like the round about ways. If someone tries to harm or attack the woman she retaliates with her blade (+12 to hit, 2d12 + 6 slashing damage and an additional 3d8 radiant damage). She will remain until the bearer of the card has asked their query or failed to successfully ask for something. If she is physically attacked by the bearer she will immediately disappear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Strength\n\n*The head of a roaring Tarrasque*\n\nThe moment the card is drawn reality slightly bends as the card changes into an Animated Armor who hold the bearer\u2019s hand and puts it in an arm wrestling position. A referee appears and puts the hands down on a table that also appears and starts the game. The bearer and the creature must arm wrestle, each time bearer wins or loses causes the creature to change into another one, the creatures faced in order are Animated Armor, Bugbear Chief, Orc War Chief, Annis Hag, Horned Devil and Belashyrra.\n\nThere are four positions in arm wrestling which is center, dominate and defense. Each turn both bearer and creature make strength check. Game starts at center position, if bearer roll is higher wins the hands move to dominate position and if the bearer has lower roll the hands move to defense position. In dominate position bearer gets advantage to strength check, if the roll is higher bearer wins and if it is lower hands move to center position. In defense position bearer gets disadvantage to strength check, if the roll is higher hands move to center position and if it is lower bearer loses the wrestle. \n\nIf the bearer or creature rolls a Natural 20 they can reroll the d20 and on a roll higher than 10 (without strength or proficiency) they automatically win.\n\nOnce all creatures are faced, depending on the number of wins the following result is obtained\n\n  \n\n|1 win||\n|:-|:-|\n|2 wins|\\+1 STR Stat|\n|3 wins|\\+2 STR Stat|\n|4 wins|\\+1 CON Stat &amp; +2 STR Stat|\n|5 wins|\\+2 CON Stat &amp; +2 STR Stat|\n|6 wins|\\+2 CON Stat &amp; +2 STR Stat, The Bearer can rage once additionally   per day |\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u201cMight is Power\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Hermit\n\n*An elderly grey bearded dusty skinned man dressed in plain robes sits with his hands wrapped around his legs staring at the prairies around him while leaning on the trunk of a tree.*\n\nWhen this card is pulled it becomes an item for the bearer. The bearer may use this card twice in order to cast Mordekainen\u2019s magnificent mansion. While staying within the mansion the Wisdom score of all creatures\u2019 increases by 2 and reverts back when they leave the mansion. Each meal within the mansion is a Hero\u2019s Feast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Wheel of Fortune\n\n*A goblin dressed in a sparkly red thigh cut dress and kitten heels holding onto a spinning game wheel.*\n\nThe card disappears and music begins to play as a narrator begins to announce \u201cThis is the Greatest Show in every Multiverse, WHEEL OF FORTUNE!!!! Let us meet today\u2019s guests (announces names of bearer and their allies).\u201d The Voice will then one by one ask each person what they desire (something plausible without a wish), once given a female goblin like that on the cards art appears holding a board with it written along with her approaches another goblin with the opposite doubled of that written (example 10,000 Gold fortune will have 20,000 Gold debt). If someone decides to add a bad luck to the options, then the additional option will be a tripled bad luck rather than a good opposite (example 100 gold debt will result in a 300 gold debt additional instead of 200 gold fortune). Once all of them have voiced their desires the narrator requests his lovely assistants to bring out the wheel. \n\nA wheel is carted into existence and all the desires as well as the opposites are placed in the wheel. The Narrator then asks who wishes to go first. Whoever wishes a try on the wheel can have a go, each time a result is obtained it takes place immediately and it is replaced. The replacement is the opposite tripled if it was a desire. If it was an opposite it gets doubled again. The turns continue until either everyone has had a go or passed their turn. The scenario ends with the Narrator bidding everyone a good day and a lot of fanfare music.\n\n**Roleplaying the card:** Cheating will result in the exact opposite to be obtained. The Narrator is a good host and tries their best to maintain order. Attacking any Goblin will lead to them disappearing and the opposites on the \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Justice\n\n*A pale woman\u2019s bust with pink lips wearing a barrister\u2019s wig and a blindfold.*\n\nThe Card disappears while a gong reverberates through space. Time pauses as the court is now in session. Three Astral titanic astral forms appear before the bearer and their allies, as they in unison say \u201c\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ you are here to be judged for your crimes\u201d. \n\nAn Illithid phases into existence listing all the major crimes done by the bearer. The Illithid then reads asks if the defendant requires a lawyer or representative, if yes then who they nominate (they are allowed anyone from the multiverse except the judges and the prosecutor). The Illithid then goes one by one through the worst crimes and the reasoning behind them, she then states for these crimes the bearer should be sentenced to death by consumption. The trial commences from this point, the bearer must defend all of their crimes before the judges or else be appropriately sentenced.\n\n*\u201cKarma exists\u201d*\n\n**Roleplaying the Illithid:** The Illithid doesn\u2019t introduce herself by any name other than the Prosecutor. She is determined to make the bearer be held responsible for their crimes. She will try her best to push for a sentence that would lead to the death penalty which she herself will administer by eating the bearer\u2019s brain. If she gets a whiff of that the allies were involved too, she will attempt to make them also be involved in the trial and being held responsible for their crime (more brain is good).\n\n**Roleplaying the Judges:** The three judges are Law, Neutral and Chaos (Law is a straight blonde woman whose eyes remain closed at all times, order is a bald dark man whose neutral expression barely changes, chaos is a pale freckled women with untamed curly red hair). Each of them see each crime with their own perspective checking for the damage done and assessing if those could be avoided by doing the task lawfully, remaining neutral or creating chaos. Judgement is made according to a vote by all three, in favor or against.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Hanged Man\n\n*A man dressed in rags dangling from a silver rope tied to an oak tree*\n\nWhen this card is drawn it changes to a rope and slithers towards the bearer\u2019s legs. Once there it whips itself into a knot around the leg and jerks upwards tied to the branch of Oak tree that rises along with from the ground. The oak tree\u2019s trunk splits into a face which slowly announces that it is time for a break and respite. The Oak will ask three riddles to the bearer and their allies, if all three are answered they will release the bearer with no consequences. If the riddles are unanswered the number of unanswered riddles decide the consequences\n\n  \n\n|One Unanswered|*Letting Go:* An enemy that had been captured manages to escape   or an important item in your possession that would aid in a quest is missing   (stolen)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Two Unanswered|*The Scapegoat:* New evidence suggests that you were the   criminal behind an old event (DM must check old quests and twist the   narrative accordingly)|\n|Three Unanswered|*Martyrdom:* A villain from a quest is tired of waiting and is   now actively taking steps forward|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u201cThe world isn\u2019t waiting for you\u201d*\n\n**Roleplaying the tree:** The tree is the embodiment of the ancient primordial force of nature. It has seen all and still sees all. It is wise beyond measure and wishes the bearer to think from a new perspective hence hanging them upside down. All the riddles asked by the Oak are about perspective and thinking differently (DM can look up riddles with these qualities and ask them). Any attempts to cutting the rope will be considered an automatic failure on one riddle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Death\n\n*An unkindness of ravens pecking at a skull of its flesh*\n\nUpon drawing the card the card sprouts wings and breaks free from the grasp of the bearer. The card splits into an unkindness of ravens who all caw as they circle around the bearer. Eight Ravens circle the area cawing one after the other. The Ravens after a few minutes begin to dive one by one towards the bearer of the card, once all eight ravens have dived two times they begin circling the bearer pecking at them one by one reducing their health until it is half. Once it has reached this point they cover the bearer with their wings. After a brief moment the ravens collapse in a mist that covers the bearer and birthing a changed person based on the thoughts of the bearer\n\n  \n\n|If the bearer thinks the card or raven is killing them|Their memories are wiped allowing them to start life afresh (Greater   restoration can cure this)   |\n|:-|:-|\n|If the Bearer thinks they will be clawed to death| They will morph into a new body (use reincarnate spell\u2019s race change   template)|\n|If the Bearer thinks they will be pecked to death|Their current relationships (casual or serious) change to the   opposite. That is if they were in a casual-relationship those people will   push for a marriage. Those with whom they were serious or married will push   for ending things.|\n|If the bearer is thinking of ways to escape| They will die and cannot be resurrected except by a wish spell|\n|If they completely accept the card\u2019s fate (i.e. not afraid of the   card or the raven)| They can choose whichever option they like|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone attempts to harm the Raven they two will also be pulled into the card affect. Everytime a Raven is killed two take its place whose heads are replaced by raven skulls. If all the Ravens are now skull headed all those who have been wrapped into the card\u2019s effect will die (resurrection is possible). \n\n*\u201cDeath is a part of life, we die several times during the lifetime in various ways\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Temperance\n\n*Two golden vapors held in a pair of ghostly pale hands. The right goblet emits red vapors while the left goblet has blue vapors emanating from them.*\n\nUpon drawing this card a marble altar appears before the bearer of the card, on which rests the two cups of the card. The bearer is drawn to drink one cup from amongst the two, and one they select one of them the other disappears into the mist. Depending on the selection they will undergo the following changes\n\n  \n\n|Red Cup|The bearer feels a sudden clarity, the intelligence and wisdom of the   person increases by 1.|\n|:-|:-|\n|Blue Cup|The bearer feels a warmth that makes him feel comfortable. The person   is healed for all his hit points, a greater restoration spell is cast upon   them.|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDetect magic cast on this reveals that the Red Cup seems to emanate a strong electric energy while the Blue cup emanates a calming cool vaporous energy.\n\nIf anyone other than the bearer drinks the red cup they suffer 4d8 lightning damage and if they drink the blue cup they will suffer 8d4 necrotic damage.\n\n*\u201cChoices in life matter as they provide the satisfaction and clarity one requires\u201d*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Devil\n\n*A bust of a red leathery skinned devil with yellow horns and orange pupils. Yellow fangs jut out from both the upper and lower jaw.*\n\nThe card disappears by catching fire and releasing the smell of brimstone. The very fabric of the space besides the bearer of the card tears allowing a Pit Fiend to emerge from the fiery portal (the portal is within 80 feet of the bearer). The Pit Fiend lumbers towards the bearer, dragging a manacle chained to something beyond the portal. Once the Pit fiend is near the bearer he attempts to shackle their neck with a tired grunt. This can be enacted with a grapple check between the two. If the bearer is successfully grappled the Pit fiend attempts to place the manacles, for this the bearer must make a Dexterity save (DC 18) to prevent the manacling. Once he has succeeded the pit fiend and fades away in a puff of sulphurous mist. \n\nAny who attempt to hinder the Pit fiend will received a hard push from him as he continues his path towards the bearer, his main focus is completing his task no matter what. If someone breaks the chain, they gain the attention of the pit fiend who screeches loudly and shouts \u201cBloody Asmodeus\u2019s Fourth Nipple\u201d before grunting and creating a portal next to himself and disappearing within it. The Pit Fiend will return back after about 1 week to repeat the process. If the pit fiend is killed he will return in 1 month\u2019s period. The Pit Fiend will continue to attempt the shackling unless someone attempts to talk to him.\n\nInitiating talks with the Pit Fiend will always start with him them about the fact that all he is trying to do is place the manacles on the bearer\u2019s neck and then he will get out of their hair. He will then agree to negotiate with them. His negotiations all will be focused on either allowing the manacling of the bearer or one of them signing a contract with him thus trumping the card. He will never reveal what the card really does but he will hint at the fact that it is two way manacle. The other way to thwart this card is by a wish spell or killing the Pit Fiend on his home plane.\n\n*\u201cBound and Bonded\u201d*\n\n**Roleplaying the Devil:** The devil is named *Shaxz\u2019kaxar (Shacks-Zay-Kacks-Sar),* he cares nothing more than to escape the bonds made by the card. If prodded he will explain that whenever the card is drawn a random Pit fiend is bound to it and is forced to manacle the bearer, he will explain that every devil under this spell is compelled to do it or will suffer radiant damage. \n\n**What the Tether Does:** This tether causes the damage to be shared by both souls (if one loses an arm the other tethered soul will lose the opposite hand). This can only be removed by a wish spell or either tethered person killing the other with their own hands (they do not suffer damage caused directly and intentionally by themselves, proxies cannot be used).",

            "selftext": "I am on probation for pleading guilty to conspiracy. Part of the terms of my probation is to not have any contact with my daughters dad unless it\u2019s about visiting my daughter. He is on felony probation but mine was a misdemeanor. He was charged with importing into state and I plead guilty to a misdemeanor \n\nHe came to CO to live with me and \n 8 weeks into his probation he strangled me and I called the police. They came and took him away and there was a no contact order placed against me and my daughter. So I was good for a few months. Until on my birthday he sent me flowers and we decided to reconcile and move in together. Things have been rocky as our daughter is pretty young and we were both adjusting to being new parents. She is 1. He asked me to write a letter to the judge stating that I fabricated the whole thing (this I have proof of in my text messages where he is coaching me on what to say) so I did in order to help his case because he guilted me saying that he was going to jail and couldn\u2019t be there to provide. Since then things have been so so at best. Friday night he came back into town because he is traveling for work even though his probation forbids it he only comes back into town when he has to drop a UA. we got into another physical altercation where I told him I was gonna call the police again because he left extensive visible bruising. He stole my phone and kept me in the house so I wouldn\u2019t leave. I was yelling at my neighbors but they didn\u2019t hear me. After a few hours my mom came to get me and I\u2019ve been at her house ever since. He has a lot of money and got a really good attorney to deal with his DV charges but I don\u2019t know what to do I feel stuck. He hasn\u2019t answered to his POV because the state is waiting to see how his charges play out he is taking his case to trial to get them dismissed. I am financial dependent on this person now I have no place to live with my infant he keeps telling me to come back but I honestly don\u2019t want to I just idk. My daughter wants to go home and I feel extremely stuck. He is financially abusive as fuck he makes me ask for anything and everything. I don\u2019t even know what I am asking for.\n\nTL:DR I am feeling stuck with my abuser who is also my daughters dad and I\u2019ve been messing up and helping him get away w it for the past couple of months and idk how to leave.",
