            "selftext": "This is kind of complicated.\n\nMy boyfriend and I are acquainted with a certain woman. We're both very poor, and she's ridiculously wealthy- think the kind of wealth that has you completely disconnected with reality. Like she lives in a million dollar per year apartment from her daddy's money. Like she doesn't blink twice at spending a couple thousand on a meal. She can pay to join 5 different MLM schemes within a week and quit them all in the same timespan and not break a sweat. And she does this regularly. She takes a week-long vacation out-of-country every month to places like Venice, Barcelona, Paris, and Dubai.\n\nThat being said, this lady is super nice, funny, generous, charismatic, and would give her own leg if it meant someone else had a chance to walk.\n\nAnyway, my bf recently hit a rough patch and ended up homeless. His extremely wealthy friend went out of her way to invite him to come live with him... As in, she heard him say it, and insisted that he come stay with her to get back on his feet.\n\nOver the course of two weeks, we've found out a couple things about her:\n\nFirst, she's an alcoholic.\n\nSecondly, she's not JUST an alcoholic... My boyfriend brought a handle(1.75 liters) of Tito's with him (that I bought!) when he moved into her apartment. She drank the entire thing that night, and the next day bought 3 more to make up for having drank it... Then drank all 3 within that week. They were gone *before* the weekend had arrived.\n\nThirdly... She's got apparently infinite resources, and uses them to get *so*. Much. Xanax. \n\nShe has 4 therapists- 2 for her anxiety, 1 for ADD, and 1 for OCD. They have each prescribed her Xanax and she takes all of them- not when prescribed, but as she feels. I'm not sure how this works, but apparently she knows the therapists don't know about each other and has kept it secret so she can keep getting Xanax.\n\nUltimately- This woman is never *not* fucked up.\n\nI stayed over one night with BF. We heard slamming doors in the kitchen so we went to investigate. She was there, barely standing straight, opening cabinet doors and slamming them closed right after. She had a bottle of water in one hand. Opened the fridge, put down her water to open a new water. Said she needed to walk her dog. Did not have a dog. Left in her Porche. Got back at 6AM, apparently perfectly fine and having had a great night.\n\nI hope you all understand the point I'm trying to portray with this background....\n\nAnyway, the great thing about people who are always fucked up is that they're always ready to party (at least, she is). The downside is that they're ALWAYS fucked up, have no logic to their reasoning, and are victim to their own whims without ever realizing. \n\nThis lady kicked my BF out after two weeks because she threw her pillow and a wine glass over her balcony and thought he did it.  She was extremely insulted and threatened legal action against him if he ever stepped foot in her apartment complex again, because- according to her- she could have lost her home and maybe even gone to jail because he \"wanted to turn *way* the fuck up\" and doesn't \"give two shits about the people who got him there.\" She said he was cruel and entitled because she was trying to give him a roof while he was down and instead he spent the whole time partying...\n\nI don't think it's too necessary to clarify that I was his only guest, twice, and that she ALWAYS had at least a few guests, and spent most of the time trashing her own place....\n\nSo now my boyfriend hates her and says he will never speak to her again. He's furious because he ended up having to move multiple cities away because she kicked him out without thinking about it. It's been three days, and she's texted me EIGHT!! goddamn times to ask why he hasn't spoken to her. SHE'S angry because she thinks he fucked up her apartment and didn't even \"have decency to send flowers or a thank-you card or anything.\" And also very hurt that he \"ghosted\" her.\n\nI completely understand BF's perspective. For two weeks he played therapist, cleaned her apartment, cooked her food, and supported her while she stayed so fucked up she couldn't walk and cried over random things like not liking her dish sponge or having too many paper towels than a person could ever use (3 rolls, Bounty). On the other hand, I think this lady grew up in a bad situation and is now living without any restriction to her many, many addictions and basically is never sober. I feel guilty being angry at her.\n\nUltimately, the only damage my BF has from her kicking him out is the destruction of his trust in humanity, which- to be fair- was already in a precarious position. I don't think this lady was justified, but anyone can fall into addiction, and in my view, she basically has so much wealth that she has no restrictions to get the (legal) drugs she wants and she's super fucked up on that. She doesn't really seem to have a sense of reason or logic, and my BF has known her for over a year, so maybe he needs to learn to identify when someone has extreme problems before he gets upset about them? I've only known her a few weeks and I could tell right off the bat that something was off.\n\nI feel like taking either side here is unfair, BUT I do want to support my boyfriend... He's my partner. I just don't think slander against a compromised person is fair??",

From what I've heard, his mom is a sweetheart. They have a very good relationship, but she still babies him.\n\n\nShe has asked him if I wanted to go to a family event once (with extended family) but he said it'd be awkward since it's the first time and she discarded the idea. I got her flowers with my boyfriend when we first started dating since it was near parents day and she was thankful for that. She asks my boyfriend if I'm doing okay all the time and how my studies are going and such. However the only thing I worry about is she thinks I'm too young. \n\n\nAs an only child, I consider myself pretty calm for my age. My parents have a 7 year age gap so I don't see 4-5 years such a big deal. She's worried since it's also my boyfriend's first real relationship. She worries for both, not just for him. She wonders if I'm lonely away from home and if he might be bothering me from studies or confusing me. But she also worries because she still sees him as her little baby and worries I might not know what I want and end up hurting him. \n\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been talking about meeting her, but I'm sharpening up my language skills before since she doesnt speak english.\nI kinda came on here for some reassurance or words of advice in this situation. I would really like to have a good relationship with his mom even if he says he doesn't care what she thinks.",

            "selftext": "December 2005, Access Magazine\n\n&gt;It's not that Brandon Flowers is mean, it's that he knows what he likes and dislikes. He doesn't like Bloc Party but he loves The Strokes. So much, in fact, that when he first heard their album Is This It, the band scrapped nine songs intended for their debut multi-million selling album, Hot Fuss. They saw that the bar had risen and they wanted to hurdle it. That's why, when we're in the basement of the East Village New York bar Niagara, and Fabrizio Moretti of The Strokes leans over to tell Flowers something, it will probably mean more to him than Moretti will ever know\" I just want to congratulate you on your success,\" he tells the 24-year-old singer. Dressed in a T-shirt and cargo shorts, Moretti is accompanied by his girlfriend of several years, actress Drew Barrymore. Today is Fab's birthday, and when it's time to cut the cake, he pulls Flowers into a small room that fits about seven and seats the singer next to him as if he's an old friend. A slice of cake is passed to Flowers who turns to me and says, \"I love chocolate cake,\" as he gobbles it down. It's homemade, presumably by Barrymore. The night carries on.\n\n&gt;Flowers and Morretti spend the entire time together, joined by other members of The Killers, guitarist Dave Keuning and bassist Mark Stoermer (drummer Ronnie Vannucci is back at the hotel with his wife). The group is invited back to an apartment belonging to Ryan Gentils, the manager of The Strokes, which is in the same building as the apartment Moretti and Barrymore share (their apartment is being occupied by Moretti's retired father who is visiting from Italy). Gentils drives us there in a minivan as Barrymore serenades the passengers with songs from the film Team America: World police. From the back of the van, where she is seated with her beau, the former child actress turned media empress chants, \"America, F**K YEAH!,\" which causes Flowers, who has never seen the film, to giggle in sweet disbelief. At this point in his life, Flowers has met them all: Morrissey, Elton John, Bowie, but it's hard to believe the interactions with people he admires were as intimate as this one. \n\n&gt;Sharing a bottle of wine with Fab and Drew outside of their apartment building as the sun rises, Flowers is nothing but smiles in his red velvet jacket. two and a half years ago The Killers were working regular jobs in Las Vegas. Well, as regular as jobs get for that area. Singer Brandon Flowers was working at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino where he was courted by aging women hoping to score with the good-looking bellhop; drummer Ronnie Vannucci worked as a photographer at the same chapel Britney Spears eloped in with her childhood friend; guitarist Dave Keuning worked at Banana Republic; and bassist Mark Stoermer worked as a medical courier transporting blood samples, which afforded him the opportunity to listen to bands he heard were supposed to be good and influential. The band played wherever they could in Vegas, but apart from a transvestite club and a cafe, there wasn't much of a scene for them to exist in. \"Dave always says that [the music scene] resembles the area around the city, which is desert and dirt, explains Flowers. \"It was terrible.\" Thanks to the influences of Bowie and Morrissey, their songs were as flashy as their surroundings on the strip, but Vegas just wasn't the right fit for them.\n\n&gt;In 2003, Lizard King Records in the UK got hold of their demo and decided to put out their album after it was passed up by nearly every American record label. However, at the yearly CMJ music conference in New york, labels had had a change of heart and descended upon their show at the rock club Don Hills. The audience was filled with AR men and young female bloggers who had discovered MP3s of Killers demos online and sung all the words to every song, taking photos and gushing to their friends over the band's good looks and even better songs. The band put on a decent performance, but many people left unimpressed. Island Records in the US saw something bigger, though, and offered them a deal on the spot, and by the next day the band had been signed and celebrated over margaritas at a Lower East Side Mexican restaurant after being denied entrance to a party held by a music magazine 50 feet away (on whose cover they would appear in 2005)Fast forward two years and Brandon Flowers exits an elevator into their hotel lobby after a long night of hanging out with his new buddy Moretti. Standing in the lobby are British band The Futureheads, who politely say hello but have a slight fear in their eyes. ;I think bands are scared of me,\"Brandon says later, \"because of what's going on with [rival band] The Bravery, and because I speak what's on my mind about other bands in interviews. I like The Futureheads.\"\n\n&gt;The Killers enter their luxury tour bus which will be taking them to Providence, RI, a New England town often overlooked by touring rock bands of their stature \u00adcarrying bags of clothing from Diesel and J. Lindenberg which they quickly empty to show to each other, tossing each other expensive pieces of clothing, saying things like \"I got this for you,'' and \"that looks good on you!\"\n\n&gt;Vannucci excitedly tells us about seeing one of the two actresses who played Darlene in the US sitcom Roseanne in Diesel.As we drive up Fifth Avenue, Flowers starts saying out loud the names of the expensive luxury stores we pass. Coming from two generations of grocers and being modestly raised in the Mormon-centric state of Utah before moving to Vegas as a teenager, he sounds genuinely excited, as if he's reading off a shopping list of where he plans on spending his next paycheck before telling everyone that he learned that Sammy Davis Jr. was a Satanist Flowers has a distinctly boyish charm. The type of person the phrase \"men want to be and women want to be with\" was created for. The fact that other bands feel intimidated by him is a testament to his impact on the music world in such a short time. He and his band took everything great about bands that appeared in the rock renaissance of 2002, made it accessible, and, more importantly, made it good. He begins to recite a list of bands The Killers love: ''We love The White Stripes, The Strokes, Ambulance LTD, Interpol, David Bowie, Louis XIV, the Arcade Fire\" before his self-deprecating side begins to show. \"What's funny is that I name all these bands and none of them would name me as a contemporary. It's weird. We brought them to another level, all the bastards - sorry. We're taking what they're doing and making it okay for people to listen to. I don't think they appreciate it.\" As much as their contemporaries would like to hate them, their animosity is only a sign of jealousy. Meanwhile, elder statesmen like Morrissey, Elton John and Bowie have attempted to take the band under their wing, while the best of the best, Bono, has all but passed the torch, calling The Killers the future of rock\u00a0and roll.\n\n&gt;We continue driving and Flowers shows off a giant pair of sunglasses he picked up recently that he's reluctant to ever remove. They're large and maroon with gold detail, and he jokes that Vannucci calls him Aunt Brandon when he wears them. Vannucci is the diplomat of the band whom all the bands they've ever played with will say they love. He's like that beloved uncle who tells the best stories at holiday dinners and has no time for whatever family politics may be going on. Two days later, in Interpol's dressing room in Boston, the band will say how much they love the drummer, and when he enters their dressing room to say hello, the publicly dour band looks genuinely happy to see him. \n\n&gt;Sitting in the back lounge as we make our way up to New England are Stoermer and Keuning. Stoermer, at 6' 4\", towers over Flowers on stage and in photo shoots, causing the 5' 10\" singer to look almost elfin. He's soft spoken and direct, holding strong meaning behind every word he utters, which isn't many if he's not familiar with you, and even if he is. Keuning, the reason why The Killers exist in the first place, is also fairly quiet, if not stoic. His chiseled face is timeless. He could've easily been wearing full-on face make-up and spandex in an '80s hair band and looked as in place as he does on stage wearing a suit jacket and eyeliner. His goal is to one day play Antarctica, and it was because of an ad he placed in a Las Vegas paper that he found a young Brandon Flowers, who had recently quit his band Blush Response. \"He put an ad in a Vegas paper looking for...anyone really...who had similar interests, and that was me. He had Oasis, Smashing Pumpkins and the Beatles as influences and that was good enough for me.\" \n\nThe duo got together, naming themselves The Killers after the name that appears on the bass drum of the mock band in the New Order video for Crystal', and began work on their first song, 'Mr.Brightside', a tune Keuning had previously started working on.\n\n\"In the beginning we weren't even sure who was going to sing,\" explains Keuning about getting together with Flowers for the first time. \"Neither one of us had a lot of experience singing. I said, 'Yeah, you got a really good voice' so [Flowers] started singing all the songs after about a month.\"Flowers reveals what's behind their maiden song: \"It's about the deep dark depths of the jealous mind. It's a dark place sometimes, and I think we captured it pretty well. I'm a jealous person so I'm good at that, and I figured it out. It's one of our true songs. Some of our songs are completely made up and some of our songs are real, and 'Mr. Brightside' was real, so it came to me pretty easily. It was a good song, but it's not ours anymore.\"; On the flipside is the dance club breakout hit 'Somebody Told Me', which Flowers refers to as their \"fun song, obvious song, but really strong at the same time. I think there's a lot of sexual energy, and every night we play it is a good thing.\" \n\n&gt;We arrive in Providence a few hours later and the band spends a nice chunk of time sound checking, which is when they get to try out the new songs they're working on. One song, which is untitled but contains the refrain \"there's a good girl in everyone,\" is so new that, when asked about it, Flowers can hardly recall how it goes. Yet for the next two days, when the band sound checks, that song is always worked on. It sounds like Bauhaus meets U2: dark yet epic, much like their other new song, 'All The Pretty Faces', which they've been playing live in their regular sets. The band is tired by the time they get on stage, since they've been touring non-stop for a year and a half, but their performance is fantastic and a world away from the one that took place at that dingy NYC rock club two years earlier. Flowers commands the stage and eggs on the audience, reaching out at one point, causing near pandemonium as girls and boys alike try to touch him. After the show, the band hang out by the bus meeting fans and engaging them in conversation. One over-eager older woman really wants Flowers to remove his sunglasses for a photo.\n\nFor whatever reason, Flowers isn't in the mood to do so, causing the woman to yell \"I'll take off my top if you take off your sunglasses,\" an offer that causes Flowers to freak out and walk away. His fiancee back home in Las Vegas would be proud. As we drive up to Boston, Flowers shares some of his new songs that he's recorded to tape in the back of the bus. Whenever he gets a free chance he is recording, hoping to make an album that's not as good as their debut but better and even more accessible while maintaining its artfulness. \"I want the next album to be American. I want it to sound like an American album with gospel choirs and pianos.\" He reveals that he's been listening to a lot of Billy Joel before saying \"we've got 50 years of rock &amp; roll, and some of it is so good that we need to listen to it and learn from it.\" \n\nThe next day, in Boston, the band s performing a radio show with opening act Louis XIV and Interpol. Big fans of Interpol, the band stays for as much of the set as possible, and even shows concern when they notice bassist Carlos D looking around for a missing soundman. Flowers looks around, hoping to find the missing crew member before being pulled away for a magazine photo shoot. When it's time for their set, Interpol singer Paul Banks spends the whole time watching from the side of the stage, smoking, ignoring the girls who are backstage ogling him. When Banks hears their new song, 'All The Pretty Faces', he asks about it and then says, \"This song is really good, it's going to be huge.\" He admires Flowers' charisma and speaks highly of him, which Flowers refuses to believe possible. Right after the show the band loads onto the bus. They're able to convince their tour manager to let them stay a few more hours instead of heading straight to their next show in Maryland, hoping they can go to a house party they heard would be fun. The bus call gets moved back, but the band remains at the venue hanging out on the bus since Louis XIV decided to bring a party to them. By the end of the night, members of both bands are dancing with their arms in the air to soul music, smiles across their faces. Flowers, unfazed, positions himself in the back lounge where he continues to work on more new songs.\n\nTen hours later we arrive in Maryland at the Merriweather Pavilion where The Killers are headlining a show they put together that will include Louis XIV, Keane, Maximo Park and Regina Spektor. Louis XIV's singer, Jason Hill, invites us to hear a Duran Duran cover of 'Save a Prayer', which he's recorded as a duet with Flowers. Hill's voice sounds perfectly hungover and\nmournful, and is a sharp contrast to Flowers' crooning. With string arrangements accompanying the track, the song sounds nothing like the original. It sounds like Vegas in 20 years.\n\nAt that point, The Killers had never headlined a show for 15,000 fans. Backstage they're excited and playful with each other. If they're nervous, it doesn't show. Someone in their crew tells them to play the best show they've got, and when they walk onstage, the screaming from the audience provides enough fuel to make that possible. The band interacts with each other, moving in, getting close, touching, smiling. Tonight, just like every other night of this tour, the band ends their set with the anthemic and uplifting 'All These Things I've Done'. But there's something special in the air tonight as Flowers says to the audience, \"There are 15,000 of you here. So I want to see 30,000 hands in the air!\" Immediately and breathtakingly, 30,000 hands rise up and begin to clap in unison as the crowd chants \"I've got soul but I'm not a soldier.\" You can hear the excitement in Flowers' voice as he sings the last line of the song to each and every fan as if they're one of his nearest and dearest friends: \"Hold on\".",

            "selftext": "  \n\nThese are notes on a series that the Theorists covered, which has released a teaser trailer for an upcoming episode.\n\n   \n \n\nThis is a horror series and involves disturbing subjects. Read with caution.\n\nCalled the Walten Files, the series is in the horror genre that involves two entrepreneurs, Jack Walten and Felix Kranken, starting a business where animatronics entertain children in the restaurant Bon's Burgers, which closes within a month because of difficulties with said animatronics. The haunted animatronics are looking to find and have Sophie Walten remember the tragedy that took place in her family, where her dad Jack trusted Felix to bring her siblings Edd and Molly to a school dance and then home safely. Tragically, Felix has an alcohol problem, drinks too much at the dance, and crashes the car, killing Edd and Molly. He feels so much guilt he buries them on the side of the road. The children's spirits are shown to rise out of their graves and possess their gray stuffed rabbit, Rocket. The Theorists predict that Edd and Molly use Rocket as a travelling vessel to get to their next host, Bon, the blue animatronic rabbit.\n\nIn the teaser, entitled \"Keep An Eye!\", the Bunny Smiles: A Cyberfun Tech Company 1974 logo is shown, but with the letters BSI instead of Bon's face. A black screen, then a C.T. Technical difficulties display is shown with the words from top-to-bottom \"C-1974 T01 Technical difficulties C.T. Please Stand By Technical Difficulties are TEMPORARY. Keep an eye!\" on the screen with a television in the middle displaying a woman's eyes looking back and forth. They do not seem to be flashing a morse code, as they repeat their pattern of looking left (from their perspective) then right (from their perspective). The nose is not included, nor is the rest of her face.\n\nA sequence of images is played, interrupting the Standby screen more and more frequently until 2/3 of the way through the video, where the screen goes black and then the words \"The Walten Files 4\" and the words \"Stay Tuned\" are shown.\n\n   \n \n\nThe images that interrupt the \"Stay Tuned\" set are described below:\n\n1. An image of Sha looking at the camera with her hand by her mouth, with a partially-covered Bon in the background with his arm reaching and disappearing behind the wall separating the two\n2. An image of the skeletal animatronic head with long ears and blue eyes that move around, and the top half of Banny's head sitting next to it\n3. An image of inside of Bon's Burgers with white wall and short-eared Banny, Sha, and Bon painted on it, in front of which seems to be a bar-style seating area with a yellow cup on the table, and in front of that there is a table in the foreground with four red chairs and what      seems like either saltshakers or shotglasses on it. It also seems like there is a figure drinking from a glass at the table\n4. Red background, animatronic skeleton head with chip getting plugged into it\n5. Zooming in on nighttime shot of white flowers or leaves\n6. A push-button radio(?) which blue color approaches\n7. An obscured object in the background behind a drawing of Sha behind Bon, and a thinking bubble coming from Bon obscuring short-eared Banny\n8. A white background that has overlay of color-distorted Banny with words \u2018SE. USER: (Banny1)\u2019 on it\n9. A blue-colored room in the background a drawing of Bon and another character with a cupboard in front of it\n10. A rectangular record player(?) with words \u201cCYBERFUN \\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d on it, with the \\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_ being difficult to read\n11. A geometric green rabbit standing up that has legs and feet glitched onto it\n12. A possible scene from the car crash because of what looks like cracked glass in foreground and moving scenery, part of which looks like a person\u2019s head, in background\n13. A photo of Bon with blue light on him standing next to wine rack that has red light on it\n14. A daytime photo of a Bon\u2019s Burgers sign, with Bon\u2019s face, six red stars, and the words \u201cBon\u2019s Burgers \u2018Come Join the Party!\u2019 Open Monday to \\_\\_\\_\\_ - 9 AM to 10 PM\u201d on it\n15. A photo of Rosemary mounted on wall that has either Banny or Bon, and Sha holding picture frame\n16. A sketch of Bon with the word \u201cBun?\u201d almost offscreen next to it\n17. A drawing of Boozoo and Bon with Boozoo animatronic singing in forground\n18. A wallpapered blue room next to a purple hallway with dark floors\n19. Slanted door with an irregular zigzag patterned wall\n20. Mostly gray Bunny Smiles Incorporated with some parts of Bon (ears and side of face) still blue\n21. News broadcast-style presentation of Susan Woodings photo and name\n22. A twelfth birthday party with Billy behind anonymous smiling children, a character nearly off-screen with more details\n23. Blue-lit trunk on white-and-black checkered floor\n24. White curtains opening in front of crowd to show Bon\n25. Picture of river and pretty garden with Boozoo edited into the scene\n26. Sha with open arms next to merry-go-round on left with pink rabbit seat and on right Bon game, with photos of Boozoo, Banny, a drawing of somebody sweeping, and two figures next to each other\n27. Background forest scene with Bon overlaid and bright      red square over part of face\n28. Mostly in dark Bon with blue light lighting up part of face, spotlight starts on his right, and approaches his face more\n\nAfter the montage of interrupted technical difficulties screens, Jack\u2019s voice is heard saying \u201cSo Edd and Molly really are gone\u201d, which doesn\u2019t sound as shocked as it chould given the circumstances. Depending on when this comment was made, the news might not have hit him yet.\n\nSome backwards audio also plays at the end, which also could be a hint at what might happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose are the notes with a little bit of speculation afterwards.",
